This was mostly during the Area 51 period when people were really fighting to get Coffee off the ground, so I might take it with a grain of salt, but it's probably real to some degree."

  <row Id="1258" PostId="1155" Score="1" Text="@hoc_age There's a pretty huge difference between this and SO spinoffs. In those cases, there were already tons of questions and users, essentially forming a subcommunity within SO - people who see each other over and over on answers and comments to the questions they care about. So when a site was created, they all knew about it, and they could very easily just move on over. In this case, coffee is a very small topic, and the people answering coffee questions on Seasoned Advice mostly never regarded it as a separate topic, so there wasn't really a subcommunity to move over."

That routinely happens here as well. I also think your doctrine is oversimplified; if something is about cooking involving coffee, as I said in my answer, people with experience cooking with coffee are much more likely to be able to help than people who focus purely on coffee."

(I haven't been checking if people here know about cooking, for example.) And in that context, not many questions are going to be up for discussion in the way your answer suggests. If you do want to discuss migrating questions we probably have to have a talk about where to draw the line before we draw any particular OP into it."

I'll start a discussion on cooking meta to try to get a sense of how people feel about it all, though." CreationDate="2015-08-12T20:51:24.360" UserId="230" />
