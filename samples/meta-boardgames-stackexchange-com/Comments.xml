However, I'd suggest more lenience on board games that include electronic components. Knizia's King Arthur for example seems like a full board game to me, even though the board has conductive ink and a voice speaks to you from the sword in the stone. I think there are a few other games where some electronic component gives the players clues or reveals goals throughout the game. There have been a few VCR / DVD games (no good ones that I know of).
