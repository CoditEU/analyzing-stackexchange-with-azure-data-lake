A question that pertains to the Catan universe could be tagged as `Catan`, but I think those will be very rare.  While our current usage basically only mentions the core game and thus one tag, more detailed tags would be better for if we get significant number of questions about the Catan games.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While I agree that when you first think of Catan, you're probably going to think of the original game, that's not gonig to be the case for everyone.  Settlers of Catan has had three major expansions and other game series like &quot;Starfarers of Catan&quot;, and &quot;Catan Card Game&quot; have been launched featuring the Catan name.  If all the Catan games could be played together, I think one tag to encompass them all would be a viable solution.  Since these are actually distinct games, multiple tags would be more precise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even the base Catan games plays very different then when playing with the Cities &amp; Knights expansion.  That's why I think `settlers-of-catan` is a much better tag then just `catan`.  Now, do we need `seafarers-of-catan` tags and `catan-cities-&amp;-knights` tags?  Maybe not." />

And another possible reason we're seeing this problem here is that for game recommendation questions, you can't just test out an answer to see if it works for you, as you can for a programming question on StackOverflow. Most of the time, to see if a game is good, you need to actually find some other players, or wait for your regular game night, convince them to play it, and then do so. It might be pretty hard to figure out in a timely manner if a game recommendation works for you. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suspect, though, that many of the current recommendation threads are not because people are actually looking for a game to play in a particular situation that is likely to come up soon, but are intended as &quot;example&quot; questions to help start the community going, for which it's even harder to actually test and decide on which answer is best for the person asking the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/132/games-for-some-kind-of-player-games-with-some-kind-of-property-questioins" />

It's for situations that aren't covered by existing references, or are covered but the information might be hard to find or expressed unclearly. A question and answer site is good for clarifying a concept, or learning how it applies to a particular situation, not simply defining it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**edit to add** This doesn't mean that I think we should close every easily Googlable question.

If someone is interested in Settlers of Catan, they might follow the settlers-of-catan tag. If, however, they have never played the Cities and Knights expansion, they might not want to bother reading questions involving it, and so set the cities-and-knights tag to ignored. That way, they can quickly scan the questions, paying particular attention to the the Settlers questions but being able to see that they can skip the ones about the Cities and Knights expansion explicitly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tags can also be helpful when someone wants to look for questions on a particular topic; they can browse questions tagged with that. If you just put the expansion in the title, and don't tag it, then it won't show up in that list when people are looking for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I'd say that if the question is about the expansion, and can only be answered with knowledge of the expansion or is only of interest to someone who wants to know about the expansion, then tag it as such.

For instance, the rule you mention, can it be played on a table, is a good one, but not sufficient, as you can sit down and play an RPG on a table, but I think that's off topic for this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few areas where we need to figure out exactly where to draw the line. To the left are what I would consider solidly on topic, to the right probably off topic, and we need to figure out where the line is in the middle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Coop games - Solitaire games - puzzles&#xD;&#xA;* Diplomatic games - creativity games - roleplaying games&#xD;&#xA;* Dexterity games - lawn games - sports&#xD;&#xA;* Board games with random or rule-based extra players - computer implementations of board games - board games with electronic components - computer games&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the first category, I think that solitaire games are on topic, while puzzles (such as Sudoku or crosswords) are off topic. But how to distinguish solitaire games from puzzles? I believe the criterion would be that solitaire games essentially produce an endless or large variety of different puzzles through randomization (most solitaire card games involve just shuffling a deck of cards, solitaire or coop games might involve rolling dice or other forms of randomization), while puzzles are static and new puzzles in a particular category (such as Sudoku or crosswords) must be created by another person or computer. I would, however, say that questions about puzzles that are specifically related to a board or card game, and commonly used in training for playing board and card games, would be OK; for instance, &quot;I'm working on this chess problem, and the book lists this solution, but I just can't figure out why this other line of play doesn't work.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the second category, I think the distinguishing criterion is that there are objective rules and win conditions in a board game. The win condition or outcome of a situation might be based on subjective votes or other actions from other players, but once people have made their decisions, there is a set of rules for determining the winner or outcome of a situation. In a roleplaying game, a GM is needed for deciding which rules to apply, running NPCs, etc, and so there is no objective set of rules for resolving situations or the outcome of the game.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the third category, I believe that dexterity games can be on topic (such as Jenga or Pitch Car), but I think that the rule you mention, that you can fit them on a table, is a good one. Thus, crokinole would be OK, but foosball or pool would not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the last category, I think that the rule that you can play it by hand, with no computer involved, should apply. You may use electronic equipment to aid you (an electronic dice roller in place of physical dice, or using a spreadsheet to keep score instead of doing it by hand), and questions about how to do so may be on topic, as long as it's all stuff that you *could* do by hand. You can't play a game of Quake by hand, so questions about Quake are off topic; but you can play Ticket to Ride by hand, so asking about places to play ticket to ride online are OK.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or to use Pat's example, Civilization and Advanced Civ are clearly on topic, Sid Meier's Civilization is not, as it can't be implemented as a boardgame. The computer game port of Advanced Civ would be on topic, as it's a game that could be played on a board, though for technical questions about it there may be better forums (or may not; people on a boardgame question and answer site may have more familiarity with the online forms of the games than people on a computer game or computer software question and answer site, and a good measure of whether something on topic is whether this is the best place to find people who can answer a question about it), and Sid Meier's Civilization: The Boardgame is on topic, as it's obviously playable by hand on a board instead of on the computer (and if anyone ever implements Civilization: The Boardgame: The Computer Game, asking about that would be on topic too, as it's still playable on a board).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do those seem like a reasonable set of guidelines? In summary, for a *game* to be on topic, it must:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Be playable on or around a table&#xD;&#xA;2. Have objective rules of play and win conditions&#xD;&#xA;3. Offer dynamic challenges, either through other players, randomization, or both&#xD;&#xA;4. Be playable by hand, by human players implementing all of the rules&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a *question* to be on topic, it must relate to a game that is on topic, but the particular instance that the question is referring to may loosen those rules. Questions about playing games with [giant pieces][1] will make a game not playable around a table, but if it's a game that *could be* or *is normally* played around a table, it's fine. Questions about Go problems or Chess problems are fine, even if they are static puzzles, since they are related to a dynamic game. Questions about computer implementations of board games are fine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that gives us a pretty good definition of what's on and off topic; there will always be some grey zone, but it will solve most of the problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Giant_pieces" />

I'm not sure how you could draw a line between solitaire and a Rubik's cube in any meaningful way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have tried to provide some criteria for distinguishing puzzles from games in [my answer to another question][1]; the one I offered is that if it has a dynamic or random setup, or random events during the game, then it could be considered a solitaire game, while if it's static unless someone or a computer creates a new instance (like a crossword or sudoku), then it's a puzzle and off topic. But by this definition, solving a Rubik's cube would be on topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I'm wondering if anyone has any better way of distinguishing a solitaire game from a puzzle, or if we just want to say that solitaire games are off-topic, or that puzzles are on-topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/174/if-you-cant-sit-down-at-a-table-and-play-it-its-not-a-board-or-card-game-goo/180#180" />

I cannot commit at this time to being a moderator beyond the beta period, but I am willing to accept the duties of a moderator until the official election, and at that time I may decide to run again, but I may step down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have extensive experience with the StackExchange platform. I have been a contributor at StackOverflow for over a year and a half, and am among the top 250 users in reputation there. I am familiar with all of the moderator tools available to those without a ♦ next to their name; I am relatively frequently involved in discussions about whether to close or make a question CW. I have also been involved somewhat at [meta.so][4], to try and make the platform as a whole better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As mentioned, I've participated pretty heavily in boardgames.se, as well as meta, to try and definite what this site should be about. I would love to see this site succeed, as I find it one of the best formats for asking and answering questions on any given topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have [participated in BoardGameGeek in the past][5], though it's been a few years since I've been active there. I also host and administer the [Looney Labs Fan Wiki][6] and [Icehouse Games Wiki][7].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as games go, I like a wide range, but tend to lean towards abstracts, Euros, and game systems like playing cards and Icehouse, while I also play a lot of word games and party games. The game I play most seriously is [Go][8], though I'm not all that good (double digit kyu, for those who are familiar with the game). I also do medieval recreation in the [SCA][9], and so I've learned and teach a good number of medieval board and card games.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my professional life, I'm a programmer, as you might guess from my StackOverflow reputation. My education is in computer science, though I studied math and linguistics fairly extensively as well. Other hobbies of mine include juggling and archery, and I commute to work by bicycle.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And finally, my approach to moderation. As a moderator, I would take the consensus of the community very seriously. If there is a community consensus on an issue, such as what is on and off topic, then that is what I will try to uphold. I am aware that the ♦ next to your name will make people take what you say and do more seriously, and so I would be very careful to be even-handed, and not take action unless there is a clear community consensus, or there is an emergency and no consensus immediately apparent. For instance, I would be very reluctant to unilaterally close a question, unless it was very clearly inappropriate and needed immediate attention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, part of the job of a moderator is to help lead the community. In cases in which consensus is not readily apparent, the moderator can be a tie-breaking voice, speaking with more authority. Our discussions are not votes; I may choose the slightly less popular choice, if I believe that it is more consistent with the mission of the community or more likely to lead the community to a better place. I will not act against a clear consensus, but I will make decisions when no consensus can be reached and no further discussion is likely to be productive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please let me know if you have any questions about me or my approach to moderation.

I haven't been as actively involved in the online board gaming community recently, so I'm not sure who all people are reading or listening to these days, but it might be good to see if we can contact Tom Vasel and have him mention BCG.SE on The Dice Tower, as that's pertty popular among gamers.

Sure, you might get a few good answers; most likely, you'll just get a lot of answers pointing to somewhere else where the question is already answered. And then we'll have the site seeded with a whole bunch of content that's just links to Wikipedia or BoardGameGeek; and anyone who looks will wonder &quot;Why would I use this site? Why wouldn't I just google, I can find better answers that way.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The best questions to ask are those that you actually need solved. Then you can provide better guidance to those answering as to whether they are helpful or not. If you know the answer to something, it would be much better to just write up a FAQ, or a blog entry, or a wiki page; if there's something you know that you want to share, then do so, but there's no reason to ask it as a question. Questions should be for approaching something from an angle that hasn't been explored before, or for when you're confused by an explanation and want clarification from an expert, or you just can't figure out how to find the needle of the one piece of information that's on some webpage that hasn't been updated since 1997 and shows up on the 6th page of all of the obvious Google searches, or you know that the answer must be simple and you keep on looking at the rules and it doesn't make sense and you just need someone to point out the completely obvious thing that you're missing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, you can do a certain amount of seeding, by asking questions that you've actually had in the past; something that you were wondering about, or some issue that bothered your group for a while, or something that came up and you've left unresolved for a while. If you want to contribute good questions, think back to real questions that it's taken you a while to solve, or you haven't solved, or you needed to ask someone else who was an expert in the topic to solve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/area-51-asking-the-first-questions/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/92/texas-holdem-shotgun-questions" />

If you have a rules dispute with a friend, link them to a question on it here. If someone asks a question on BGG, and there's a good answer here, link to that. If you copy the link directly from the &quot;link&quot; that you see under the tags (right click it and choose &quot;Copy Link Address&quot; or something similar), then the number of people you refer will even be counted, and you can get a badge for helping to publicize a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An obvious place to mention BCG.SE is BoardGameGeek, and it might be good if you have a personal blog, twitter feed, Facebook account, or the like, to mention that you've been involved in a private beta of a board game Q&amp;A site that is now entering it's public beta. I haven't been as actively involved in the online board gaming community recently, so I'm not sure who all people are reading or listening to these days, but it might be good to see if we can contact Tom Vasel and have him mention BCG.SE on The Dice Tower, as that's pertty popular among gamers. Again, we should try not to be to contact any one person or forum too excessively, but make sure that we get our name out there to a few important places.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any other thoughts on how we should publicize BCG.SE, without spamming?

If the question is answered adequately by that quote, that's perfectly fine. Note that in this case, it should be made clear that it's a quote (using the blockquote markup, prefixing each line with `&gt;` or using the `“` button above the editing area), and the source should be linked to, as otherwise you are plagiarizing someone else's work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other cases, the best answer might be a link plus some extra explanation describing how that link relates to the questioner's specific situation, or a link plus a summary of the contents of the link.

Many traditional questions get their correct answer quite quickly so in most situations I'm left with:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- voting up answers&#xD;&#xA;- the occasional comment&#xD;&#xA;- the even rarer exotic question that does not yet have an answer and I happen to actually know something about it&#xD;&#xA;- and the kind of questions that cannot be fully answered&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only kind of questions I can reliably contribute to are the ones that - according to official policies from the founders - should be community wiki. Their reasoning is that CW fosters contribution. I don't see it that way - exactly the opposite actually.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Contributing to CW earns me no recognition. Don't get me wrong - virtue IS it's own reward but when you are given the choice between receiving recognition for your help or not: what do you prefer? The entire SE/SO system is so focused on rep. Everything depends on how much rep you have.&#xD;&#xA;2. Anyone can answer a question but you need 100 rep to contribute to CW so you are actually shutting members out that probably would like to help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what am I saying about CW? What is it good for IMO? For &quot;moderators&quot; to condense discussions into separate posts. Nothing else comes to mind right now." />

My conclusion was that we're more complimentary to BGG, rather than competing with it, though obviously there's a certain amount of competing for people's attention and time. To quote myself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; StackExchange is a question and answer system which has grown out of the very popular http://stackoverflow.com/, a Q&amp;A site for professional programmers. It has several advantages over other forums or Q&amp;A systems. Unlike forums, you don't have to wade through pages of responses to find the actual answer to a question; answers voted up will move to the top, and the questioner can accept an answer which will become the top one. Unlike other generic Q&amp;A sites, StackExchange sites have specific communities devoted to the topic in question, not just a lot of people answering questions on everything. And unlike most sites of the sort, it also involves wiki-style community editing, in which users with enough reputation can edit questions and answers to provide clarification, fix small errors, or clean up formatting or tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; BoardGameGeek is a great resource, and the Board and Card Games StackExchange is complementary to it, I think. BoardGameGeek has a lot of information on it, and sometimes people might not be able to find the needle they're looking for in the haystack of BGG.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First of all, yes, BoardGameGeek has some definite advantages in the size of the existing community, and the integration of its game database. The first is one that can hopefully be improved as this community grows; likewise, the issue you mention about designers already being on BGG could be addressed by getting designers to answer questions here as well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The integration issue might be able to be addressed here; some other sites have added JavaScript to make domain-specific features work (such as rendering TeX on the math oriented sites, or a shortcut for [adding card images on a Magic: The Gathering SE 1.0 site][2]); it might be possible for us to do the same here, adding a feature that could easily embed BGG game links and/or images.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But that still leave the fact that in the meantime, as we grow our community, we need to be able to say what differentiates us. I think there are few things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The biggest benefit is the actual StackExchange system with questions, answers, voting, and editing. On BoardGameGeek, if you want to ask a rules or strategy question, you have to do it in a forum format. This means that you ask a question, and then there may be several replies of varying quality that are hard to sort through. In some cases, you may get several pages of replies, at which point finding anything is quite hard, and the SEO will be totally broken because the question and answer will be on different pages. On StackExchange, the best replies will be voted to the top; the one that actually answers the question will be at the top and prominently marked. Small errors, or typographical or formatting issues, can be fixed by anyone with enough rep to edit other people's answers (or left as a comment that will be displayed immediately below the question or answer), instead of having to keep reading through the thread to find the one bit of errata that someone else posted.&#xD;&#xA;* The simplicity and focus of the site. BoardGameGeek is very complex and busy, with lots of stuff going on. It can be hard to figure out how to ask a question, or where to look (a few of my more poplar answers here have simply been instructions for how to use BoardGameGeek effectively). StackExchange, in contrast, is relatively simple and focused on question and answers. I've pointed out BoardGameGeek to people and heard &quot;ow, I can't even figure out where to start looking.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;* Better SEO. This is related to the above; the simplicity and focus on SE sites, as well as the emphasis on quality content through voting, helps it achieve better Google rankings. There have been questions that are answered on BoardGameGeek, but a simple search didn't answer it; I had to try adding &quot;site:boardgamegeek.com&quot; to my search in order to find the answer, and filter through a lot of irrelevant results.&#xD;&#xA;* The Creative Commons license on all of the content is another reason that I prefer to use SE to BGG. I used to contribute fairly heavily to BGG, but BGG and the authors of any content retain sole rights to any of the content posted there. Thus, BGG is allowed to use and profit off of my content as they see fit, while I'm not allowed to use the database or anyone else's content for any other purposes. This makes it hard to, say, create a read-only fork of BGG with a better interface, which could be quite useful and by competing with BGG inspire them to clean their interface up a bit. BGG is a collaboratively edited resource, but pretty much wholly owned by a few individuals, while all of the content in SE is available for anyone to use as they see fit (within the bounds of the license).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/578195/board-game-question-and-answer-site-in-beta&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://draw3cards.com/questions/234/how-do-i-enter-card-images-in-questions-and-answers/" />

BoardGameGeek has a lot of information on it, and sometimes people might not be able to find the needle they're looking for in the haystack of BGG.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First of all, yes, BoardGameGeek has some definite advantages in the size of the existing community, and the integration of its game database. The first is one that can hopefully be improved as this community grows; likewise, the issue you mention about designers already being on BGG could be addressed by getting designers to answer questions here as well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The integration issue might be able to be addressed here; some other sites have added JavaScript to make domain-specific features work (such as rendering TeX on the math oriented sites, or a shortcut for [adding card images on a Magic: The Gathering SE 1.0 site][2]); it might be possible for us to do the same here, adding a feature that could easily embed BGG game links and/or images.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But that still leave the fact that in the meantime, as we grow our community, we need to be able to say what differentiates us. I think there are few things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The biggest benefit is the actual StackExchange system with questions, answers, voting, and editing. On BoardGameGeek, if you want to ask a rules or strategy question, you have to do it in a forum format. This means that you ask a question, and then there may be several replies of varying quality that are hard to sort through. In some cases, you may get several pages of replies, at which point finding anything is quite hard, and the SEO will be totally broken because the question and answer will be on different pages. On StackExchange, the best replies will be voted to the top; the one that actually answers the question will be at the top and prominently marked. Small errors, or typographical or formatting issues, can be fixed by anyone with enough rep to edit other people's answers (or left as a comment that will be displayed immediately below the question or answer), instead of having to keep reading through the thread to find the one bit of errata that someone else posted.&#xD;&#xA;* The simplicity and focus of the site. BoardGameGeek is very complex and busy, with lots of stuff going on. It can be hard to figure out how to ask a question, or where to look (a few of my more poplar answers here have simply been instructions for how to use BoardGameGeek effectively). StackExchange, in contrast, is relatively simple and focused on question and answers. I've pointed out BoardGameGeek to people and heard &quot;ow, I can't even figure out where to start looking.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;* Better SEO. This is related to the above; the simplicity and focus on SE sites, as well as the emphasis on quality content through voting, helps it achieve better Google rankings. There have been questions that are answered on BoardGameGeek, but a simple search didn't answer it; I had to try adding &quot;site:boardgamegeek.com&quot; to my search in order to find the answer, and filter through a lot of irrelevant results.&#xD;&#xA;* The Creative Commons license on all of the content is another reason that I prefer to use SE to BGG. I used to contribute fairly heavily to BGG, but BGG and the authors of any content retain sole rights to any of the content posted there. Thus, BGG is allowed to use and profit off of my content as they see fit, while I'm not allowed to use the database or anyone else's content for any other purposes. This makes it hard to, say, create a read-only fork of BGG with a better interface, which could be quite useful and by competing with BGG inspire them to clean their interface up a bit. BGG is a collaboratively edited resource, but pretty much wholly owned by a few individuals, while all of the content in SE is available for anyone to use as they see fit (within the bounds of the license).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, I disagree with your point about the focus being broader here than at BGG. I think that what's on topic at each is pretty much equivalent. BGG has Risk, Monopoly, and Trivial Pursuit pages, with forums that people discuss them, which can show up on your front page. There may be a slightly different proportion of questions on certain games here vs at BGG, but that's going to be the case anywhere; I don't think that in the long run, there will be much more discussion of Trivial Pursuit here than on BGG, especially if we succeed in getting more serious gamers involved here. And if there are games you're particularly interested in or don't want to hear about, add them to your &quot;interesting tags&quot; or &quot;ignored tags&quot; lists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/578195/board-game-question-and-answer-site-in-beta&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://draw3cards.com/questions/234/how-do-i-enter-card-images-in-questions-and-answers/" />

When describing something, it's nice to provide a link so the reader can find out more. But there are frequently several good choices of what to link to, and I'm not sure which to pick.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;BoardGameGeek has a ton of information, including categorization of games, recommended numbers of players based on user votes, a description, reviews, discussion, file uploads for player aids and rule translations, and so on. On the other hand, the page is extremely busy, it can be hard to navigate, and you sometimes have to click through quite a lot to find all of the information it has to offer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For many games, Wikipedia has a good article on the game. On Wikipedia, you have a much cleaner interface, and see pretty much all of the relevant information on one page. It doesn't have as much information on precisely categorizing games, reviews, ratings, or the like, but for the information it does provide, it can be easier to navigate. It also sometimes provides historical background or other information that BoardGameGeek does not or may be hard to find on BGG.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then there's the official site for the game itself. These vary in quality; some of them just provide very basic information in the form of a blurb and a box cover. Some of them provide a good deal of information, like rules, strategy guides, errata, payer aids, and the like. They are generally promotional in nature, so you get to see how the company is trying to sell their game rather than what other people think about the game.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another option is to link to Amazon or another online store. This allows anyone interested in the game to buy it right away, and will generally have some description and review information, but may not be appropriate for everyone on the site as other online stores might be more appropriate depending on their country.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you're reading about a game in an answer, which of these sites do you prefer to get a link to? Is there a good rule of thumb about which link or links I should provide?" />

It is more likely to know any particular game. Wikipedia lacks pages for many less mainstream games.&#xD;&#xA; 2. It is a site dedicated to games and almost always contains or links to more additional info (Images, Reviews, Discussions, Comparisons) than wikipedia.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and thus more interested in a game's origin, cultural impact and other aspects of it's &quot;historic importance&quot;. BGG focuses on aspects that are of more immediate interest to gamers - such as:&#xD;&#xA;  - a quick summary of the game concept&#xD;&#xA;  - player count, duration, age suitability&#xD;&#xA; 4. It is easier to correctly identify the desired game it case of ambiguous names.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For these reasons I prefer BoardGameGeek over Wikipedia or the often very short official pages. I personally won't go an place multiple links to the same game on alternate sites - I'm too lazy for that.

The most current example is [Who is your favourite game designer?][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, to some extent I sympathise with the problem the moderators face. You don't necessarily want to just close these questions without any community support, lest you face the accusation that you are being too heavy-handed or authoritarian. You may expect the community to eventually deal with the question. However, in the interim, the question continues, people get points, and it seems unfair. Or maybe you just have a more liberal outlook on subjective questions, and feel that more site content is basically a positive thing. So, CW, and where's the harm?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this situation, it may seem reasonable to convert the question to community wiki. No one gets any rep any more, the close votes can continue to accrue, and if the community feels strongly enough, it will eventually be shut. Also, on Stack Overflow, there is a history of users pressuring others to convert subjective questions to CW, normally with the threat of close votes if they do not comply (the so-called 'Wiki police'). This is a norm that many users feel they understand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are four problems:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Subjective questions are not inherently evil. But they are much harder to write well. Most of them are poor questions, and should not exist. This is described in detail in the blog post [Good Subjective, Bad Subjective][2]. This is official Stack Exchange policy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Converting a post to CW requires moderator intervention. It therefore sends out a strong signal. It says &quot;I am a moderator on this site, and I think this question is ok, because I haven't stopped it, and in fact I am encouraging it to exist.&quot; This is harmful. Most users are not very experienced with the Stack Exchange engine, and they are looking for guidance about community norms. This sends the message &quot;lousy questions are fine, as long as a mod can stop by and fix them up with CW.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Community Wiki was recently [banished for all normal users][3]. Why was this done? Why can only moderators set the CW flag? It happened to avoid exactly this situation - weak questions being protected from closure by the nullifying of reputation gains. CW was originally intended *only* for the situation where you have an answer, and would like to explicitly dilute your ownership, and encourage the community to improve it. It is a signal that says 'this content is jointly owned - please improve it'. The reputation feature is just a side-effect. Preventing reputation increases is *not the purpose* of community wiki.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. It is no longer reasonable (if it ever was) to pressure users into making questions community wiki. This is also [official policy][4]. The line is now much sharper; for almost all questions, they either should exist, or they should be closed. There is no CW limbo space. And it's not sufficient that a user request their question be wikified either; the reason for the CW needs to be clear and *valid*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please can we stop hitting poor questions with the community wiki flag without careful thought?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/1456/who-is-your-favourite-game-designer&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/392/should-the-community-wiki-police-be-shut-down/7183#7183&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/392/should-the-community-wiki-police-be-shut-down" />

It wasn't a lazy, thoughtless question designed to snag a hundred replies and some free reputation - or at least, that very much wasn't the intention!

HOW is that any more subjective than &quot;what game would you recommend to someone who is looking for a game by a truly great designer (please show your workings)&quot;?

Rather than mention some games that we play in the question itself, I decided to post them as answers.

This was questioned so I decided to remove my answers pending further discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not sure if my question should be made community wiki or not. It seems to me like it probably should, but I find the CW criteria pretty vague now. However, that's not what I want to focus on here. The debate over subjective questions and CW has been had elsewhere. I'd like this to focus on answering one's own question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I agree with the general sentiments expressed [here][2] in that I generally don't ask questions I know the answer to and, if I do, I wait a while before providing my own answer. However, that is my personal preference and I don't know if I would want to make that a rule. I think every member of the community has the right to answer any question, even questions they asked. In general, it may not be advisable to do so right away in that it may discourage others from answering and may result in the question and answer not being upvoted much, but that's at the discretion of the questioner, IMO. However, I think that mostly goes for objective questions. I'm not sure it's as much an issue for subjective ones. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, is answering one's own question right away discouraged?

I however recognize the need for quality - and frequent lack thereof in these questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My reasons for allowing game recommendations:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Common need** - As boardgamers we all share the desire to find new exciting games to play.&#xD;&#xA; - **Rephrasing pointless** - There is no way to around asking for recommendations if that is what you are looking for. No amount of &quot;officially sanctioned&quot; questions can replace the conciseness of a well phrased &quot;game recommendation&quot; question. Hoping that by banning such question will make users post lots of good &quot;sanctioned&quot; questions is illusory. A user who would not invest enough effort to ask a good &quot;game rec&quot; question will certainly not invest enough effort to ask X &quot;sanctioned&quot; questions instead. Not gonna happen...&#xD;&#xA; - **Prolonged Usefulness** - Unlike the fast paced world of video games or technical products a good boardgame will likely remain popular for years to come. Thus a good recommendation will remain valid far longer in our field.&#xD;&#xA; - **Not disruptive** - I've seen people argue that &quot;too many&quot; [what's that exactly?] game recommendation questions would disrupt the site. Stackoverflow has tens of thousands of tags to categorize its questions. No one over there needs all of them. From the perspective of a Java developer any question relating to .NET, Python, VB, PHP is essentially dead weight. Arguing that one single category of questions is disruptive is unrealistic when confronted with the huge success of StackOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Great subjective questions are more than just mindless social fun&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please join me in encouraging questions that meet the qualifications for &quot;Good Subjective&quot;.  You can do any or all of the following (depending on rep) as you feel correct for the particular question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Comment** on questions that are Bad Subjective encouraging the submitter to improve the question (Please be polite, *especially* for new users)&#xD;&#xA; - **Flag** the post for moderator attention&#xD;&#xA; - **Vote** it down (please remember to revisit occasionally to see if it has been improved)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A question is ultimately judged upon it's answers (see #1, #2, #4 in particular).

I have a hard time imaging folks only caring about one of the two groups.  Those tags are contained within the name of the site, we already know we are here to discuss them :)&#xD;&#xA; - Boxes - There isn't any reason to create a tag to anticipate potential future usage.  A question about artwork and a question about how best to store game boxes does not have any overlap of interest necessitating a tag.&#xD;&#xA; - Furniture - I don't think we are going to have too many subject matter experts on furniture here.  Why would a grouping of the two questions noted be beneficial to a SME?  The on site search is useful to find questions for anyone who needs to find them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, I'm pessimistic about new tags.  It doesn't mean that all new tags are bad, however the majority of tags that I think we need probably need to be hashed out on meta first.  A better set of game classification tags would be great, for an example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a tag is created with an anticipated usage of 1-2 questions, and that tag doesn't stand on its own then I don't think there is value in that tag.

Does card x work in way y, or not?&quot;, which is answered inside of five seconds by a passing diehard (&quot;It certainly does, as it clearly says on P13 - I've c&amp;p'd the relevant paragraph here&quot;) will before long earn the answerer an easy three figures of reputation, as everyone else who looks at the question goes into an upvote-clicking frenzy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Far be it from me to say there is no value to an objectively correct answer!

Does card x work in way y, or not?&quot;, which is answered inside of five seconds by a passing diehard (&quot;It certainly does, as it clearly says on P13 - I've c&amp;p'd the relevant paragraph here&quot;) will before long earn the answerer an easy three figures of reputation, as everyone else who looks at the question goes into an upvote-clicking frenzy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Far be it from me to say there is no value to an objectively correct answer!  But I'm wondering if I'm approaching things in the wrong way.  Here's how I do things.  If I ask a question and I get a brief, but obviously correct answer, I bestow upon that answer a green tick.  If I get an answer that goes above and beyond, is interesting, or makes me laugh, I may also upvote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If I see a correct answer, I don't auto-upvote it (unless there's some controversy in the answers, and a wrong answer is in danger of gaining supremacy!).  Should I?  I guess it's valid to say that an answer that's correct looks &lt;i&gt;more obviously&lt;/i&gt; correct if it's been upvoted a dozen times, which could reduce confusion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the risk of a glib analogy, suppose on the Mathematics stack exchange someone asks &quot;What is the answer to 1 + 1?&quot;  Within three seconds someone has answered &quot;2&quot;.  Should this earn ten thousand points of reputation over the years because it's (under most reasonable circumstances) correct, while the person who cracked Fermat's Last Theorem only earns a few points, because no one has the time to wade through the hundreds of pages of proofs that made up their answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My philosophy is this: upvote more questions that aren't basic and more answers that aren't obvious.  That green tick is reward enough for people (like me, quite often) who are just on the site all the time with nothing better to do, and who can find the appropriate paragraph in a rulebook!  Or have I got the wrong end of the Stack entirely?" />

Off-topic questions get closed by the community *anyway*, in an open and transparent manner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is very rarely a *need* for a moderator to close a question, unless it is blatant spam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the key things that made StackOverflow, and now all the other SE sites, work is that they shape themselves. Rules aren't so much laid down from Above, they often emerge through *users* commenting on questions, voting to close, voting to reopen, upvoting and downvoting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or to put it another way: I've been active on StackOverflow since a month or two after the site launched. I don't think I've *ever* seen a question that was closed by a moderator. Deleted, yes, or locked, sure, those have happened a few times, but simply closed? I can't recall ever seeing it. Because it's unnecessary, and it might spark too much friction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here, though? It seems like 5+ of the questions *on the front page* alone have been through that wringer. That is **insane**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The community is perfectly capable of closing questions. Let it do its thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Modrators should enforce the community's policy, in the rare cases when the community is unable to do so by itself. They should not try to define the policy themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(and yes, this is a major difference from how moderators are typically expected to act on &quot;traditional&quot; forums, where they are the only channel through which a thread can be closed)&#xD;&#xA;" />

Programming languages, game development, math, and many other subjects are inherently non-subjective. Its pretty easy to see what topics are useful, and what topics aren't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Games on the other hand are supposed to be **_fun!!!_** What's fun is going to be subjective a lot of the time. This site is different from the other sites in that its objective is fun instead of knowledge. If you guys disagree and say that knowledge of games is more important than fun, IMHO you're missing the point of games! :D&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this site wants to be able to compete with other sites, its going to need to change its goals a little. Would you rather go to a slightly less well designed site based on board game fun like BGG, or an SE site based on knowledge with strict limitations on the types of questions allowed? This site is **very** unfriendly to new users and frankly I wouldn't recommend it to any of them **yet**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I totally agree that the mods are closing too many questions (no personally offense to them whatsoever, I greatly appreciate the time and effort they've put into their jobs :). &#xD;&#xA;Take a look at these questions that the community upvoted several time, but one mod closed:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[What Risk variants do you like?][1] 15 upvotes, 7 favorites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[what games use the worker placement mechanic?][2] and [economic games for mature players?][3] 10 upvotes each and one mod closed them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[5 other highly voted but closed questions][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Please open your ears and listen to the community before closing stuff!!!! There are more to board games than rules!!!!** :D :D&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Put it this way. People come to Stackoverflow because they want to get answers to objective programming questions. Programming is a huge profession that you can make a living with, and many people do. People go there to learn from others and solve problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This site is about games. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the vast majority of people play games and go to board gaming sites for fun. If what you want from a programming site is strict restrictions to objective only questions, that's fine, and this site could fill that role perfectly. However, IMHO some people want to have fun and ask questions about recommendations and other subjective topics that SO would deem less than perfect. If this site feels like turning them away, we will only be left with questions about rules and strategies. If that's all this site wants to be, that's fine. However, I believe very few people have a reason to specifically talk about strategy and rules and NOT anything subjective/fun, so this site would be left with a very small user-base. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Closing fun questions just makes the site unnecessarily strict. They are closed on SO because they are not very useful as programming is about skillfully communicating with computers. Board Games are about fun, and restricting well written, on-topic, useful fun questions is only going to hurt us when the whole site revolves around a source of fun anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I think we need to do is make the site a little more friendly. I doubt most of you had the first 3 questions asked on a stackexchange site closed with almost no explanation. I did, and it doesn't feel good. If this stupid site doesn't want my questions, I'll leave. And I almost did. Fortunately, I stayed and came to love it. The more we can make new user's experiences nicer, the more users we'll have and the more awesome the site will be. When users have a nice first experience, they tend to stay. Light-handed moderators are a huge part of this. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/108/what-variation-alternative-rules-do-you-play-on-risk&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/19/what-board-games-use-the-worker-placement-mechanic&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/921/what-business-finance-board-games-for-mature-players-are-available&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/search?tab=votes&amp;q=closed%3a1" />

But this site isn't really making itself very attractive for the casual viewer. I guess what it boils down to is that I don't really think there's a market for a site that does absolute nothing but answer direct questions about board games. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This site is choosing to be the place for objective questions about rules and perhaps some game mechanics and other strictly policed topics. What you are allowed to discuss is very limited. If you want to ask a question that's not allowed here, meaning virtually anything subjective where you just want to talk to some fellow people who love board games and get there opinions on game related stuff, you might as well leave straightaway. This site is not about fun. This site is not about talking with your fellow gamers casually. This site is about questions, and answers. That will be your only interaction with the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Board Game Geek is different because its just....fun. You can do everything that's offered on this site, like talk about rules and strategy, but you can also just relax with your fellow gamers. You can rate games, talk about your sessions, ask the advice of tons of other gamers about what games you might like, and rate games as to how much you've enjoyed them to help others when they're looking to try something new. Heck you can even get into some polite arguments about what games are better than others; it's all in the interest of fun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may call all the other stuff 'noise' that gets in the way of the 'true objective questions'. But I don't think anyone else does. You can get whatever experience out of the site that you want. Its just a one-stop-shop for everything you could want to talk about regarding board games, and I still don't see what's to keep people coming here for the tiny topics the sites do overlap in. Yes this site is not at all designed to be like that or have any of those features and they would alter the site greatly if it did, but I don't think we're going to convince people &quot;ask your rule and strategy questions here! (even though that's all we really offer and if you want anything besides that you have to go to other sites that also offer Q&amp;A just like ours. But ask those questions here anyway!)&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't get me wrong, I love this site to death, and if the community wants me to shut up about this topic I will duct tape my mouth shut, never speak of it again, and continue to answer questions and edit tag wikis gleefully. But I'm honestly worried that other people aren't going to want to join in our little slice of paradise here because we offer so little. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Can anyone point out some flaws in my logic? Can this site really make it as a Q&amp;A only deal? Is having questions with no one objective answer really such a bad thing that we need to purge every example we see no matter what effects it may have? I still don't understand why these subjective questions are so bad in the first place.

The ultimate goal is to have a good question with a definitive answer.  And some of these questions do have definitive answers. What would be the worst case is for a &quot;Game Like&quot; question to be down-voted or deleted without the merits of the question being considered at all, just because it contains a known pattern.  Especially with this site in beta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Good**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If the question asks for a comparison of game mechanics, then it is a very good question.  Most mechanics can be analyzed and compared objectively with other games.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If the list of correct answers is too long, then the question should be written to be more specific or broken into multiple questions.  The correct answer may even be that the list is too long with a reason of why.  This would give gamers new to a game some insight as to a game's classification or a specific mechanics popularity among games in general.  &quot;Here are a few popular ones, but there are too many to list.&quot; can be a very useful answer in some cases.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If the question asks for an answer that can differ between people, it may still be a good question, and the correct answer may be a list of things that should be considered.  Questions like game length could fit this category.  Game length can be analyzed and calculated for different groups.  It may have a large deviation, but it is still a number.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Bad**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If the question mentions only a game, but doesn't focus on a mechanic, then it should probably go.  Unless the game is so unique that all the mechanics can be considered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If the question is asking for a comparison of a subjective topic, like &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;best&quot;, then it is really too broad for a definitive answer and should be closed as such.  Fun can't really be&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If the question is asking for a recommendation of a new game to players of a different game, it should be removed because that is subjective.  (Only Netflix can answer that. ;) )&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the best outcome here is to make these well written questions. The answers may be difficult to find and there may need to be a fair amount of discussion before a correct answer is found, but as long as an answer bubbles up at the end, it was a good question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These questions are also moving targets, as new games are developed.  In which case the selected answer should be added to.  It's the same with many programming questions too.

The whole point is that the closed question is put in time out until the problem is resolved, at which point it can be re-opened--or deleted if no one cares enough to fix the problem. I've seen questions get closed, fixed, and re-opened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for **down voting**, it really has a different purpose. Closure indicates a structural flaw in the question: it's an exact duplicate, it doesn't have an answer, it belongs on another SE site, etc. Down voting serves to suppress a question that doesn't meet the criteria for closure (i.e. there's nothing structurally wrong with it), but just isn't well asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jeff points out a good criteria as he explains why the down vote hint has changed: a good question is not only useful but reflects a little bit of work on the part of the questioner. Now this isn't a coding site, so the idea of research is likely to be a little different, but I always cringe when I see someone ask a question that is answered by quoting a crystal clear sentence from the rules. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Take a strawman question like &quot;How many dice do you roll in Monopoly to figure out how many spaces to move?&quot; It's a board game question, so on topic; it's objective, a real question, not a duplicate, and not too localized. But, it's boring and lame an has an easy answer (and isn't even worded very well). I'd down vote that because the question is disrespectful of the time that another person might take to answer it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This mechanism is likely to get better as more people get the 500+ reputation needed to vote to close or reopen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To fill these gaps, and to move the process along, we also have moderators. That's a good thing. I'm all for giving moderators &quot;supervoting&quot; privileges, under my proposal, three ordinary votes. But I'm not willing to give one five, because I don't think one person, even a moderator, should have UNILATERAL closing privileges.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I see it, there could be two ways to close a question. The first is when TWO members of the community vote to close. Then a mod comes along and completes the closure with a triple vote instead of waiting for three more from the community. End of story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second type of closure could be initiated by a moderator, followed by two additional votes from the community. It would highlighted as a &quot;proposal to close&quot; and would state the moderator's reasons. The proposal would remain open for up to 48 hours to attract two more close votes from the community, or conversely, vote to re-open. This would also give the questioner a &quot;notice,&quot; plus an opportunity to fix the question. At the end of 48 hours, it would be re-evaluated as discussed in the closing paragraph.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a community member, I would likely suppport a moderator his merits. In this example for instance, http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/4061/what-is-a-good-place-to-buy-board-games-in-new-york I didn't exactly vote to close, but did raise a question about its merits (since I'm relatively new to the site).  I would certainly have contributed one of two votes toward a moderator initiative to close this question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what would happen after 48 hours? At that time, the close-reopen votes be tallied. To tip the balance, a SECOND moderator could close the question with three additional votes (six in total), unless there were two or more &quot;reopen&quot; votes from the community (which would reduce the tally to minus 4). I understand that there are two types of moderators, those drawn from the community, and those drawn from the site itself. Ideally the two closing moderators would have one drawn from each group.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your thoughts?" />

Would you rather moderators unilaterally *deleted* inappropriate questions?

Everything they do is logged, and *most* of their actions are visible to some or all of the larger community. We trust their discretion, and trust the community to keep them honest. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's really nice when moderators don't have to do most of the moderation. But this requires a healthy, active community of voters - and it's not unusual to see sites where getting two user votes with a moderator vote is *rare*. Shrugging our shoulders and letting the site descend into ruin waiting for enough users to take an interest in moderating is a recipe for disaster. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you feel a moderator - or 5 normal users - have made a bad call, *say something*! Bring it up here on meta. Frank, open discussion tends to be a *lot* more effective than increasingly complicated voting systems, especially when getting users to vote is already difficult." />

It's not really the fault of the OP, who by his own admission is inexperienced, but the question is naive and the answers are not likely to be helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It really doesn't make a lot of sense to me to talk about how to beat a chess computer. To try and identify a particular 'style' associated with chess A.I. in general, or with a specific chess engine, and then to work against that style, may be possible. It's just not a very good idea. There are only two ways to go with the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) **Talk about classic A.I. weaknesses.** You could say something about how a weak A.I. tends to be poor at sacrifices and combinations, or rook endings, or obscure openings not in its opening book, and waffle a bit about search depth. Whether or not that applies to a modern A.I. on your Mac is probably going to be pure speculation. Whether you can usefully exploit it is speculation again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) **Talk about general chess improvement.** Practically, this is the better answer, since your time would be much better spent improving at chess, than at improving against some peculiar A.I play style. However, clearly, such an answer has nothing to do with A.I. It's also a huge, far too broad topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some A.I. programs allow you to 'dumb down' their playing ability, so that you can have a more balanced game. That seems like the obvious fix, if winning is actually the goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A more general point is that improving at chess requires being regularly beaten by good play, so that one can learn and raise one's game. In that sense, the feeling of frustration and striving is rather like learning a musical instrument. If a player doesn't find anything intrinsically enjoyable about that, then chess probably won't be a particularly fulfilling game." />

I can't directly compare as I don't have access to statistics for either site (other than # of questions), but judging it and B&amp;CG's active questions page, D3C's activity looks about equal (or perhaps even greater) to the entirety of B&amp;CG.SE's activity. So it looks there is in fact a market for Magic Q&amp;A, but all of the users are over on some SE 1.0 site! Boo!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, can we convince them to move over to B&amp;CG.SE? I think there's a few things that D3C has that are standing in the way there:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* expansion tags, complete with appropriate symbols&#xD;&#xA;* links to cards in Gatherer that show the card when you mouse over them&#xD;&#xA;* lots and lots and lots of Magic-specific tags&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first could be accomplished via &quot;sponsored&quot; tags with icons. I doubt it would be, because it would probably just be confusing to non-Magic users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second, however, would need to be custom functionality written by the SE team for one SE site, which as far I know is not something that they do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding the third, I figure a lot of these tags would be weeded out according to the SE network tag guidelines, but some would probably still be useful. Even less would get the chance to continue exist in a merger with B&amp;CG.SE rather than a Magic.SE site, I think.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall, I'm in favour of whichever way gets more Magic questions and answers in the SE 2.0 network, whether it be attracting D3C users to B&amp;CG.SE, creating a subsite (portal) on B&amp;CG for Magic and attracting D3C users that way, or creating a Magic.SE site to get D3C to move over wholesale.

(This question may require occasional maintenance if some of the links rot, but that can happen on any question with references.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;MtG, on the other hand, has gone through a significant amount of change, and in all likelihood will continue to do so. Valid answers now may become invalid answers in a year or two ... as adamjford points out in a comment about the old Shandalar game for the PC:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Problem is there would be a HUGE learning curve when you transition to modern rules (the stack, no interrupts, combat), and there would be no familiar cards whatsoever (except maybe Giant Spider and Lightning Bolt.) I say this even though I loved Shandalar to bits back in the day. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I think the closure reason here is that the question is relevant to &quot;a specific moment in time&quot;. I'm not sure whether it would be sufficient to change the question to ask what to buy to teach 2011 MtG to someone, nor whether this is the line of logic that Pat applied, but it seems like a starting point to me." />

Are there questions appropriate for one thing, that are not appropriate for the other?  Second, can a high reputation for the one give you a high confidence in the answer for the other?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, looking at Magic, Chess, and Dominion as examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Are there questions that would be appropriate in a &quot;magic only&quot; site that wouldn't be appropriate in board &amp; cards games?  This gets into issues like the degree of subjectivity allowed.  I can foresee many questions about strategy and deck-building that may fall too far into subjectivity for the BCG site (which tried to have 'correct' answers).  Contrast this with Dominion, which, while it has many cards, has much more straightforward answers because the number of different cards is nowhere close to MTG.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. If someone has a high reputation answers questions about Magic, should that mean that person is trusted to answer questions about Chess, and visa-versa?   This goes to the degree of overlap of that expertise.  In my experience, it takes a lot of dedication to be a true expert at MTG, and that would be at the cost of expertise in other board and card games.  I, for one, *used to be*, an expert in magic, but it's changed so much in the past 10 years that I would no longer consider myself one.  This ability to have expertise go stale isn't as much of an issue in other BCG.   If I haven't played the last 3 Dominion expansions, but was an expert in the first 2, I can 'catch up' with relatively little time and effort.  This is not the case with MTG where the game 'completely' changes due to new rules and card sets of a tremendous scope." />

To me, the real value of those specifics is as a jumping-off point for clearer, more grounded communication.

To put it more simply, I think an answer that talks about tapping out for a powerful 6-drop is likely to be more relatable -- even if that six-drop used to be Keiga but now it's Grave Titan -- than an answer about Vampiric Tutor and Ancestral Recall. Standard is just closer to how Magic is &quot;designed to&quot; work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, anecdotally speaking, when I play casual Magic before FNM draft, I'm almost as likely to see Lorwyn cards as I am to see Scars cards.

Specific expertise is bound to be useful: a great Bridge player could have a lot to say about such a hand, how they might have bid it, what went wrong at the table in question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, this question doesn't definitely have a right answer.

I need to know the publication date of the game in order to tag the question.  This may be difficult to obtain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3B. To tag the question, I only give what I know about the game (designer, publisher, date, etc.) and it's also allowed to leave it ambiguous.

They're awesome questions .... for a forum.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a Q &amp; A site, [Real Questions have Answers][2]!  Game Recommendation questions are asking for individual items or games, not really answers.  People can earn a lot of rep just by being the first to mention a popular game.  After all **Dominion** is probably a great answer for most any question that starts with &quot;What's a good game for ...?&quot;  Folks then vote for the answer which says Dominion because they know it and agree that it's a good game for the purpose.  There doesn't need to be any substance to the answer.  **Nothing is learned, no experience needs to be shared.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Votes should indicate quality.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Too many answers###&#xD;&#xA;It doesn't take an expert to recommend a game, anyone can do it.  And will.  Game rec questions can quickly grow to many answers.  After a certain point, any new answer has virtually no shot at rising above the existing answers no matter how good it is.  We can't expect folks to pick out the diamond in the rough when it's the 15th answer on a page.  A great question will have upwards of 5 answers that we can evaluate and vote between.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###They attract more recommendation questions###&#xD;&#xA;When people see these questions they think that they are allowed and acceptable here.  We can't really fault them for this.  Let's clean things up so that we avoid that confusion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you've read this far, thank you for your attention!

I think we've gone through a similar situation on Gaming, as you can see in the [FAQ entry](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/q/1617/8366) there, with a longer explanation [here](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/q/997/8366). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's very difficult to get a recommendation question to work in this format, and even if we manage to get one that does work, it then leads to a series of closed questions, frustrated users, and &quot;Why was my X closed when Y is open?&quot; questions on meta. Of course we'll get that to some degree with any type of question, simply because we're no different than any other online community in certain respects: we have standards which we expect all users to follow, and all internet sites experience a sort of entropy, in that their content will naturally tend to degrade over time, requiring constant effort to keep up quality. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's certainly worthwhile to do that for cases where it's the question itself that needs help, but when the topic is also a problem area, we can end up spending a significant amount of mod and user time just to end up with well-written questions that still don't fit the Stack Exchange format. We can spend a lot of time talking about the differences between &quot;what games are like X&quot; and &quot;what is the best game like X&quot;, for example, but that won't change the point of the question: tell me about a game like X. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And it's not as though we don't have a place where those questions can be asked. It's possible to have forum-like discussions in chat, and honestly, I think that's the best place for game-rec questions anyway. The best recommendations, in my opinion, come from people who a) know you well or b) know the type of game you're looking for well. Those attributes can be hard to identify in a Q&amp;A format ... but they can be teased out with the back-and-forth nature of chat. (We also avoid the additional problem of extended discussion in comments: another area where it's hard to allow exceptions, because otherwise we spend a lot of time explaining the difference between an exception and a particular case.)" />

It's the kind of tag people will want to follow. In fact, if you're a hardcore Magic player, you can follow that tag, [use that][1] as your homepage, and just never see the rest of the site at all! A tag like [tag:bidding] isn't going to be used like that. In your SO example, I think that's a key difference between [tag:c#-4.0] and the non-existent [tag:c#-polymorphism] - the former is top-level, the latter is not.&#xD;&#xA;* **Tags should be as simple as possible.** Tag conventions are great, but most users don't know or care about what they &quot;should&quot; be using. Most people would just tag [tag:bridge] [tag:bidding] and move on. Any policy that doesn't do what people expect needs to be considered carefully.&#xD;&#xA;* **Special conventions need maintenance.** The corollary to the previous point is that higher rep users will have to do more monitoring and retagging when non-obvious conventions are in use.&#xD;&#xA;* **Determining game-specific tags is non-trivial.** How do you make the distinction between a tag that only applies to a single game, and one which is more general? It's impossible to guarantee that no other game has the concept of &quot;manabase&quot;. Even worse, they might have a similar mechanic, but call it something a bit different. Choosing where to draw that line with specialised tag naming is going to be endless.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One place where this might be a little different is the case of game expansions, and how they should be tagged.

External&#xD;&#xA;&gt; APIs, meaning interfaces that anyone on the web can use, take a bit&#xD;&#xA;&gt; longer to develop and put additional strain on servers, but do allow&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the community the freedom to develop their own look and feel around&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the services.)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; There are no current plans to implement an API like this in the near&#xD;&#xA;&gt; future, but it's certainly something we'll keep in mind when&#xD;&#xA;&gt; developing out improvements to the Gatherer system and other tools we&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have in the works that build on top of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking around at other sites, it looks like they've either scraped Gatherer or are hot-linking it (as Draw3Cards appears to do).  Hot-linking makes me very nervous, period, unless it's explicitly allowed; content just disappearing a puff of smoke when an implementation detail of Gatherer is changed is pretty scary (I'm ignoring the conscientiousness of it for now, though that's pretty rough as well).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [Terms Of Use][3] also seem to forbid either approach for commercial entities.  So we're out of luck both technically and legally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/askwizards/0408&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.wizards.com/Company/About.aspx?x=wz/company/about/termsofuse" />

The assumption is that all questions tagged with expansion Y are saying &quot;expansion Y as part of base game X&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Questions about multiple expansions and the related base game###&#xD;&#xA;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/1191/1140  &#xD;&#xA;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/3529/1140  &#xD;&#xA;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/3192/1140  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Don't** tag with expansions.&#xD;&#xA;- **Don't** tag with the base game.&#xD;&#xA;- **Do** tag with the series. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course if that turns out to be the consensus, we would have to determine how to create series tags, and like on Gaming, that will create some issues.

Text="Where the Magic questions go, so goes my nation; I'm committed to the MtG proposal, but if it is determined that it isn't necessary and that Magic has a better home here, so be it. Regardless of where it is, however, what is important is that working with Magic posts is convenient - at the moment, it is not.

I can say personally (having been involved in said questions) that not having an inline JavaScript card preview is a ***tremendous*** pain. That particular feature is pretty much *the* necessary feature on dedicated Magic sites (whether they be blogs, deck builders, trade sites, etc.).  I don't see symbols as particularly important, but having a card preview is key.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT:** After reviewing the information @KevinMontrose added, I totally understand the legal reasons preventing this from happening at the moment. However, as a stopgap (that could be expanded to image support, should it eventually be possible), could we automatically link to the Gatherer web page for the card in question? It should just require an alteration of any however-tagged cards to [http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?name=+\[&quot;cardname&quot;\]][1] (e.g. \[mtg:Lightning Bolt\] to [http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?name=\[&quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;\]][2]). That way, we use official sources without scraping, and have a methodology in place to expand to images if it becomes possible later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT II: THE RETURN OF EDIT:** After some additional discussion in chat today, I propose a markdown syntax of `[mtg:cardname]`. This would allow the regex to be fairly simple (and similar to tag replacement, as the tag syntax is `[tag:tagname]`) - all it would have to be is a regex replace, replacing the suggested markdown with pattern of &#xD;&#xA;&gt; `\[mtg:(?&lt;cardname&gt;[^\]]+)\]` &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and replacement string of &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; `&lt;a class=&quot;mtglink&quot; href=&quot;http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?name=%5B%22$1%22%5D&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/a&gt;`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternatively, if this type of one-off work is a pain, a structure for generalized HTML creation based on some simplistic syntax would be nice, to allow people to write user scripts to do the rest of the work. Some syntax to create a `&lt;span&gt;` tag with an easily-customizable class would let you move all of this into the &quot;do whatever you want with these with user scripts&quot; realms, instead of having to handle each of these requests as they come. Some may be more complex than others (Go, Chess, Mathematica, etc.), but others (like this) are simple.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?name=%5B%22cardname%22%5D&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?name=%5B%22Lightning%20Bolt%22%5D" />

But when he told me that it was based on some experience as a game designer and extensive experience as game tester, the answer improved even more for me as I wasn't sure if it was just a best guess or based on experience. In my mind, this convinced me that I should &quot;accept&quot; this answer (though I haven't quite yet in case a better answer comes along to this fresh question). So I suggested to Aramis in comments that he add the following sentence to his answer:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Based on a few games I've designed and extensive play-testing where suitability for children was a common designer question, here's what I've learned . . .&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aramis did not think this was a good line to add to the answer.

It allows&#xD;&#xA;&gt; us to vet things with our own experience and testing, our own&#xD;&#xA;&gt; understanding of material.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second is a blog post which discusses best practices for answers that are subjective in the sense of not being provable or something you can cite. This SE blog encourages the community to follow 6 principles developed by the moms4mom group. Here are principals 4 and 5:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4: Great subjective questions invite sharing experiences over&#xD;&#xA;&gt; opinions. Certainly experiences inform opinions, but the best&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subjective questions unabashedly and unashamedly prioritize sharing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; actual experiences over random opinions. It’s more useful to share&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with us what you’ve done than what you think. Everyone has an opinon.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It takes zero effort or imagination to have an opinion about anything&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and everything. But people who have done things, real things in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; world, and have the scars and arrows in their back to show for it —&#xD;&#xA;&gt; now that’s worth sharing. You should be uniquely qualified to have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your opinion based on the specific experiences you had. And you should&#xD;&#xA;&gt; share those experiences, and more specifically what you learned from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your experiences, with us!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5: Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; facts and references. Opinion isn’t all bad, so long as it’s backed up&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with something other than “because I’m an expert”, or “because I said&#xD;&#xA;&gt; so”, or “just because”. Use your specific experiences to back up your&#xD;&#xA;&gt; opinions, as above, or point to some research you’ve done on the web&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or elsewhere that provides evidence to support your claims. We like&#xD;&#xA;&gt; you. We want to believe you. But like wikipedia itself, {{citation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; needed}}. And good subjective questions make this clear from the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; outset: back it up!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key phrase in #5 is &quot;Use your specific experiences to back up your opinions&quot; and the key phrase in #4 is &quot;the best subjective questions unabashedly and unashamedly prioritize sharing actual experiences over random opinions.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we're to follow the guidelines suggested in this SE blog post, then it *does* make sense to cite one's experience as related to a question and its answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An introduction like &quot;Based on a few games I've designed and extensive play-testing where suitability for children was a common designer question, here's what I've learned . . .&quot; would seem to be in the spirit of describing one's actual experiences that the answer is based on. It may not be the optimal wording (feel free to suggest improvements).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But an introduction like this does help provide the experiential context for the answer, and that makes the answer better for questions of this nature." />

Experience is closer to what I meant, and I think people were responding to connotations of the word &quot;expertise&quot; that I did not intend." Text="From my initial read of the generic Stack Exchange FAQ, I was under the impression that answers from personal experience are not just encouraged, they are preferred. Right? If so, does it not then follow that one should cite specific &lt;s&gt;expertise&lt;/s&gt; experience(s) that might help lend credibility to an answer, on a topic for which little public information is available and no mathematical proof is possible?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The specific example is the question I asked about age suggestions: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/6964/how-do-game-designers-come-up-with-suggested-or-minimum-age-requirements-for-g&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aramis's answer seemed reasonable, especially after some clarification in the comments. But when he told me that it was based on some experience as a game designer and extensive experience as game tester, the answer improved even more for me as I wasn't sure if it was just a best guess or based on experience. In my mind, this convinced me that I should &quot;accept&quot; this answer (though I haven't quite yet in case a better answer comes along to this fresh question). So I suggested to Aramis in comments that he add the following sentence to his answer:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Based on a few games I've designed and extensive play-testing where suitability for children was a common designer question, here's what I've learned . . .&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aramis did not think this was a good line to add to the answer. He stated that, &quot;In fact, that's one of the things that, in my undergrad, we were taught to treat as a fallacy - anyone whose sources must include their bonafides in order to be credible is probably including them solely to be credible at all.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not getting this. While some types of questions have a strictly objective answer based on mathematical proof or have publicly available information to cite, other types of answers may depend on having actual specific experience. This seems like one such instance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So for this example, and for other questions of this nature, is it a good or bad idea to cite your own question-relevant &lt;s&gt;expertise&lt;/s&gt; experience(s)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

I think it would be useful for enthusiastic gamers who are new to Stack Exchange to have this reference post for information like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When did each game-related stack start it's Beta?&#xD;&#xA;Did it start independent or part of another stack to be later spun off?&#xD;&#xA;Was a new stack proposed but purposely NOT spun off?&#xD;&#xA;Why did it spin off and/or not spin off?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't want to see long explanations - just a date, title, and 0-20 words for each event with perhaps a link to a more in depth explanations of why various game stacks split off B&amp;CG or started independently.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why is this useful?

I could see this as bi-weekly articles covering either new games we played for the first time and the games first impressions, new decks we tried out in a multiplayer environment, or an overview of a game and our impressions about why a particular player won.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Do we want to review product? I have a closet full of games, but I don't suffer from the obsession that many do that are from the cult of the new. I do have some coworkers though that enjoy buying and playing newish games. I wouldn't mind offering up some reviews of board games. I could see reviewing games on a monthly basis, so that users have enough time to play 4-10 games to get a good sample size.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - In depth strategy articles or something like the Game Tech podcast that discusses game theory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do we have enough interest within the community to make posts, or have people read them? If I am the only one interested in this, this will fail horribly. I would think that we need at least 5-6 regular contributors, and 2-3 users who are good editors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not sure the best way to track interest in the community. Upvote this post if you are interested in reading a blog? Upvote individual answers with (Product Review, Session Report, In-Depth Strategy) to indicate interest in what articles you would want to read.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Maybe a seperate thread with people interested in contributing, and another thread for people interested in consuming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What does everyone think?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackexchange.com/2011/06/blog-overflow/" />

Text="Kevin Montrose's [answer in that question](http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/679/13280) provides all the reasons an *image* hotlink is not legally or technologically a good idea. Yes, it is frustrating that everybody and their brother has an autocard feature. An homegrown hotlink system will likely never happen, for the reasons he provided.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT: However, the Wizards-official AutoCard feature you suggest means that Kevin's answer should be reevaluated - given that it's an official API, it should alleviate all of their concerns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Secondarily, if it is decided (for whatever reason) that the AutoCard definitely won't work (meaning we can't use the official API, and we almost certainly can't use image hotlinking for the reasons previously provided), I don't believe we've heard anything yet about [my suggestion](http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/670/1328). It's been revised some since the last time we discussed all this. It does unfortunately share some of the technological hiccups - we'd be autogenerating a search link for Gatherer, and if Gatherer ever changes, it's possible for our links to go kerblooey. However, it does mitigate the legal issues somewhat, and given that we aren't hotlinking to a specific ID-based page or anything (just a search), it seems a bit less risky to me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**TL;DR - AutoCard please!**" />

Again, with a twist, if even still the same twist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Meta sites often see people discussing specific questions that have been closed to determine whether or not they can (or should) be reopened, but it's rare that anyone looks at questions that are open and answered. Are they better than what the Internet has to offer? Are we making the Internet better?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's a rough guide:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Below, you'll find ten questions randomly selected from your site over the past 60 days.&#xD;&#xA;- For each question, search the internet for the question as if you were the asker!&#xD;&#xA;- If our answer(s) is good (complete, well-written, answers the question, useful, found in search results, etc) then **vote it up**!&#xD;&#xA;- If our answer(s) is bad (incomplete, poorly-written, off-topic, incorrect, unfindable, worthless, etc) then **vote it down**!&#xD;&#xA;- I've included my own commentary from my run of the review. These are in spoiler blocks. It's up to you whether you look at them post-fact just to see how your perspective compares, versus letting my views shift your opinion of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Comment with anything you feel is worth noting, or to explain your voting choice. We have a rough guide to better/par/worse [right here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EQxi7.png). **If your result is par, make a choice to vote up or down.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that our goal is to make the internet a better place. If you find yourself unable to decide how to vote, ask yourself: does this question and/or answer make the internet better? How you answer that question should determine your vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Talk to your fellow community members about how your site is doing and what you all can improve. Above all else, remember: this is a *team effort!*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Please note: this evaluation will close on April 24th, 2012! Get your responses and votes in by then!**" />

I am not sure that answers quoting that source would be much better. Examples below (titles linked to OP for comparison). If you ask me, it isn't much better, but we will see how many votes they get in comparison. With out any ultimate authority, who is to know if quoting the Basic Rules or the Comprehensive Rules is better, people on the internet will have to decide.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[**If an opponent unsummons my Goblin, does it spoil my Goblin Grenade?**][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Your opponent may only cast [mtg:Unsummon] on your goblin when they have priority. Your opponent gets priority after you **pass**. Wou will have finished casting your spell and paying all necessary costs at this point, and the goblin you sacrificed will be in your graveyard. (From the [Basic Rulebook][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Since players can cast instants and activate abilities during each other’s turns, the game needs a system that makes sure **only one player can do something at a time**. Priority determines, at any given time, which player can cast a spell or activate an activated ability. The active player (the player whose turn it is) gets priority at the &#xD;&#xA;beginning of each step and each main phase—except for the untap step and the cleanup step. **When you get priority, you can cast a spell, activate an activated ability, or pass (choose to do nothing).** If you do something, you keep priority, so you make the same choice again. If you pass, your opponent gets priority, so now he or she gets that choice. This goes back and forth until both players pass in a row.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **ADDITIONAL COST** - Some spells say they have an additional cost. To cast that spell, you must pay both the mana cost in the upper right corner of the card and its additional cost.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **CASTING A SPELL** - To cast a spell, take the card you want to cast from your hand, show it to your opponent, and put it on the stack. ... Now check what the spell’s cost is. Tap your lands to produce the mana necessary to pay that cost, and pay it. Once you do that, the spell has been cast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---------------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[If they counter my Goblin Grenade, do I still lose my goblin?][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes. You pay costs to take actions. This includes Mana Costs listed right of the Card Name, and any additional costs within the cards Rules Text. Nothing in the Basic Rules allows you to get back costs that you paid to cast a spell. Remember, your opponent is paying a cost to counter your spell (usually a mana cost, and the instant counter spell that will leave their hand and go to their graveyard). It wouldn't be fair for them to have to pay to counter your spell, if you just got your resources back.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **COST** - A cost is something you have to pay to take another action. You must pay a cost to cast a spell or activate an activated ability. Sometimes a spell or ability will also ask you to pay a cost when it resolves. You can’t pay a cost unless you can pay all of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **COUNTER A SPELL OR ABILITY** - To cancel out a spell or ability so it has no effect. If a spell is countered, it’s removed from the stack and put into its owner’s graveyard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Can Dismember kill my Gloryscale Viashino after I cast Armadillo Cloak?][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes. Spells and abilities do not resolve immediately. Each player has the opportunity to respond to the [mtg:Gloryscale Viashino]'s +3/+3 triggered ability. We know that the Gloryscale Viashino's ability is a triggered ability, because it starts with &quot;Whenever.&quot; Only the top spell or ability resolves, so for your opponent to kill your Gloryscale Viashino, they need to respond to it's +3/+3 triggered ability. When they do this, [mtg:Dismember] is added to the top of the stack, and it will be the first spell or ability to resolve. The stack will look like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [mtg:Dismember] - Gloryscale Viashino gets -5/-5 until end of turn.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **GV triggered ability** - Gloryscale Viashino gets +3/+3 until end of turn.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [mtg:Armadillo Cloak] - Enchanted Creature gets +2/+2, trample, and gain life triggered ability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If both players pass at this point, the Gloryscale Viashino will get -5/-5 until the end of the turn before anything else on the stack resolves. Because it's toughness is 0 or less, it will killed (&quot;die&quot;) and will be placed in its owner's graveyard. The remaining spells/abilities on the stack will fail to do anything, since the Gloryscale Viashino will no longer be on the battlefield (assuming that Armadillo Cloak was targeting the Gloryscale Viashino).&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **RESOLVE** - When you cast a spell or activate an activated ability, or when a triggered ability triggers, nothing happens right away. It just goes on the stack. After each player gets a chance to respond to it, it will resolve and its effect will happen. If another spell or ability counters it, or if none of its targets are legal when it tries to resolve, it won’t resolve at all (and if it’s a spell, it’s put into its owner’s graveyard).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **RESPONDING TO A SPELL** - The spell doesn’t resolve (have its effect) right away—it has to wait on the stack. Each player, including you, now gets a chance to cast an instant or activate an activated ability in response. **If a player does, that instant or ability goes on the stack on top of what was already waiting there. When all players decline to do anything, the top spell or ability on the stack will resolve.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **TRIGGERED ABILITIES** - A triggered ability is text that happens when a specific event occurs in the game. ... Each triggered ability starts with the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” You don’t activate a triggered ability. It automatically triggers whenever the first part of the ability happens. The ability goes on the stack just like a spell, and resolves just like a spell.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/7708/prateors-grasp-can-opponent-determine-taken-card-before-shuffle&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/7865/if-an-opponent-unsummons-my-goblin-does-it-spoil-my-goblin-grenade&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/resources/rules/EN_MTGM13_Rulebook.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/7864/if-they-counter-my-goblin-grenade-do-i-still-lose-my-goblin&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/7874/can-dismember-kill-my-gloryscale-viashino-after-i-cast-armadillo-cloak&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Different clubs have different default systems (Standard American is not universal even in the USA, and practically unheard of elsewhere); different books have different definitions of the system; different pairs have different understandings of the book.  There was originally a 'natural' meaning for each bid; but even if if still exists (doubtful), it doesn't cover any bid about which a question is likely to be asked. For example, a take-out double is clearly a conventional bid; when to make it depends on what your system prescribes. As one commenter on the example said, 'You think it's a textbook bid to make: I think it's a textbook bid to avoid. We may be using different textbooks'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Would it be helpful to replace the 'bidding' tag with a set of sub-tags, (perhaps 'bidding standard-american', 'bidding acol', 'bidding precision' and 'bidding non-conventional')?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or should we discourage this sort of question entirely?  They may be too localised to be of value to future enquirers; the point-count for a specific bid will be affected by what point-count is required/permitted for other bids, which may mean the question requires a book-length answer; and they do by their nature require discussion and advice, rather than the clear objective answer SO sites usually look for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(I don't mean to sound pompous, still less to criticize TomAu; but I think the point should be discussed.)&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/8176/1644" />

In addition to the game name, if it's tagged as beginner than I should keep my answer simple (or avoid it altogether if I hate answering newbie Qs). If it is Bridge and it's tagged bidding, it may help me to more quickly figure out that this is a question about bidding, not declarer play. Far more useful would be specific bidding systems like &quot;standard-american&quot; or &quot;acol&quot; as I could then ignore what I don't know (acol) and only look at what I know (standard american).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If I could not filter in the active view and quickly determine what a Q is about, I might have already given up as an active user as I have not played Magic the Gathering and several other popular games - it would be too much trouble to pick out Qs of interest to me for either reading/voting or answering." />

[tag:house-rules]: 4. [tag:game-design] has 23, but that makes some sort of sense, because in another context the topic is deep enough to [merit its own site][gamedev]. Of course, on that site, nothing is tagged game-development.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as what the actual purpose of tags is, on this site? I don't know that anything has changed since that original discussion. Here's an excerpt from [Mag Roader's answer][answer]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In my opinion, most questions should have 1 tag - the game they are asking about. I'm not seeing much value from the extra tags. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With that in mind, I would say the purpose is to link questions to the game or games about which they're asked, or to a topic like [tag:history] if the question is not game-specific but is also on-topic for the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[soblog]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/&#xD;&#xA;[old]: http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/10/1140&#xD;&#xA;[gamedev]: http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;[answer]: http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/80/1140&#xD;&#xA;[rpgmeta]: http://meta.rpg.stackexchange.com/q/363/1636" />

In [November 2010](http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/267/1140), we talked a little bit about how to get our numbers up. One of the 15 &quot;Top 7&quot; questions is about [how to promote the site](http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/33/1140). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And it's a problem that all beta sites deal with. Some just deal with it better ... and some have an easier time of it because of their audience. (Arqade, for example.) Either way, our goal has to be reaching a sustainable volume of good questions that can get us out of beta: if we seed questions, at some point we'll run out. If we lower the quality threshold, then even if we do get out of beta, we become just another site, with the added bonus of having to explain why these old questions were all closed while these new questions are allowed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think Alex has the right idea - more people asking more questions about more games. goldPseudo touches on some of the problem, that there are a lot of games that are designed not to bring up questions. (Chutes and Ladders, right?) But there are plenty of games that **do** bring up questions, as we've seen with MTG. We just need to tap those audiences (uh, not in a MTG sense), and that means pretty much the same thing it does for everyone else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Individually, we can promote the site through social media, especially by posting questions that need answers. We probably all are connected to people who play games but aren't here yet, and maybe seeing a question they can answer will draw them here. We can remember to ask questions here when they come up while we're playing games ... but again, these should be good questions, not questions-for-the-sake-of-asking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also like [Pat's suggestion](http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/340/1140) from the Top-7 question: work with cons when we can. Drawing questions from attendees themselves is a great idea, although we would have to emphasize that they won't necessarily get an immediate answer (i.e. we're not a replacement for GMs) even if we make more of an effort to watch for questions during cons. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there is a smaller con in your area, you might be able to work with the mods and SE so that BCG can be represented there. (Larger cons probably require more advance planning and more work. I've been looking for an excuse to go to Gen Con, which is local to me, but as Pat points out, the ROI for us may not be worth it.) In a sense, game nights at home are baby cons: we can use those as an excuse to post questions here when they come up (again, real, high-quality questions, not things like &quot;Can I move forward with a 4 in Sorry?&quot;), and maybe get one or two new people to check out the site as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All that is really about time and effort. Anything else is just fool's gold: there is no point in getting out of beta if we do it as Yahoo Answers 2. " />

I've received 1 upvote for 3+ questions at a time quite frequently.  I assume that is when someone discovers that &quot;Yes, B&amp;CG does cover that game, cool!&quot; and goes thru reading all the old questions we have.  Folks are more likely to get this serendipitous discovery from our front page questions.&#xD;&#xA; 1. The questioner may switch their accepted answer (or award it for the first time) - Although this is pretty rare, I have lost several accepted marks from people who came in much later with more comprehensive answers than mine were.  I've also gained a couple by coming in later too, it works both ways!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your goals are strictly the gameification, then perhaps old questions are not the best &quot;bang for your buck&quot;, but I think a few well placed answers to older questions can benefit the site and yourself just fine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now I'm going to test my theory by inserting this answer to your 5 month old question :)" />

This is what the `source` of the post now reads:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Unfortunately you are not allowed to mix-and-match with units from different Codices any which way.  The different books are tuned somewhat to have different strengths and weaknesses.  What's acceptable in 'normal' play is of course up to the people you play with!  If it's something fun and flavourful, most people will probably allow it.  If you pick and choose the best unit in each slot from each Codex, don't expect anyone will allow it.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    However, as of the publication of the 6th edition rulebook in July 2012 an army may have an 'Ally Detachment' containing a limited number of selections from another codex.  An army based on one the Space Marine Codex can include these others as allies:&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    **Battle Brothers:**&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;     - [Black Templars][2]&#xD;&#xA;     - [Blood Angels][2]&#xD;&#xA;     - [Dark Angels][3]&#xD;&#xA;     - [Space Wolves][4]&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    **Allies of Convenience**&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;     - [Grey Knights][5]&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;      [1]: http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Black_Templars&#xD;&#xA;      [2]: http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Blood_angels&#xD;&#xA;      [3]: http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Dark_Angels&#xD;&#xA;      [4]: http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Space_Wolves&#xD;&#xA;      [5]: http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Grey_Knight&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Of course you can paint your models any way you like and have a mix of units from different 'Chapters' as long as the actual rules in use form a legal army.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Editing in content from comments:&#xD;&#xA;    There has in the past been a ruling in the Grand Tournament FAQs that if you use an 'official' paint scheme, the army must use the corresponding Codex or the 'vanilla' Codex: Space Marines.  e.g., no Red Marines with blood drops on their shoulders &quot;counting-as&quot; Black Templars.  But red marines with blood drops counting as plain old vanilla codex marines are ok.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    Edit: adding content provided by purefeet so that the answer accepted by OP is up to date&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can see where part of my [answer][3] has been copy-pasted wholesale, the citations floating part way down the answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Had I wanted to merely update the accepted answer I could have done so.

Perhaps since the [origin of the site][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Over the last few months I've been proactively removing certain meta tags from any question on the front page. The majority of those have been [tag:rules] and [tag:strategy].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why these tags are bad:&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the defining characteristics of a meta tag is that it can't stand on it's own.  If these tags exist, then people can, and do use them as the only tag on a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next Steps:&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Build consensus** - I've spoken to the other mods and a few of the more active members of the site and I *think* there is consensus on removing these tags.  It'd be better to have that consensus be explicitly stated here on meta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Remove the tags on older questions** - Over the last few months, due to normal front page rotation, the count of [tag:rules] has decreased over 10%.  However that still leaves 438 as of this writing, and another 161 on [tag:strategy]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you agree with me that these tags should go, feel free to join in on my effort.   Ideally we don't want to flood the front page with old questions.  But something like 5 at a time is cool.  Then pause for a few hours, see if those old questions get pushed down again and do 5 more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternatively, you could note a couple new questions that need editing, but first, clean up some older questions, then edit the new ones to put them back on top.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe slow and steady will win this race.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Identify other meta tags** - I'm sure there are more.  For new nominations, please put them in an answer (1 per) to allow debate.  If we get consensus, we'll edit them in here on the question and open season on them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/80/40" />

Until there are enough people who naturally hang out in chat, people have to &quot;seed&quot; it by making more of an effort to hang out there and talk about things ... or even to play. (Depending on the game, players may want a separate room. Random comments may work better in some play-by-chat games than others.) And it's not like seeding the main site by asking questions we really aren't facing, because this is simply making people more available in case someone drops by for whatever reason ... quality of conversation in chat isn't at all the same type of issue as quality of questions on the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think this is much different than asking how to grow the site in general, because everything basically depends on everything else. Chat becomes more active with more people on the site. More people means more questions, more answers, and more meta activity. More people in chat means more off-topic questions diverted there (because there's actually someone around to answer, or to try to answer; it doesn't sound quite the same to say &quot;you can ask this in chat, though&quot; when no one is there to help) and more conversation. More conversation in chat can lead to more questions on the main site. It's just hard when the site hasn't yet reached critical mass and it isn't clear how we can get more active participants on the site. " />

Also, I don't see a Tag Wiki section of my review tab, nor is my own tag wiki edit appearing my my Review/Suggested Edits tab. Should I be able to edit a tag wiki without approval? If not, should the 1500 beta rep for approving tag wiki edits be changed?" />

Perhaps since the [origin of the site][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Over the last few months I've been proactively removing certain meta tags from any question on the front page. The majority of those have been [tag:rules] and [tag:strategy].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why these tags are bad:&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the defining characteristics of a meta tag is that it can't stand on it's own.  If these tags exist, then people can, and do use them as the only tag on a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next Steps:&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Build consensus** - I've spoken to the other mods and a few of the more active members of the site and I *think* there is consensus on removing these tags.  It'd be better to have that consensus be explicitly stated here on meta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Remove the tags on older questions** - Over the last few months, due to normal front page rotation, the count of [tag:rules] has decreased over 10%.  However that still leaves 438 as of this writing, and another 161 on [tag:strategy]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you agree with me that these tags should go, feel free to join in on my effort.   Ideally we don't want to flood the front page with old questions.  But something like 5 at a time is cool.  Then pause for a few hours, see if those old questions get pushed down again and do 5 more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternatively, you could note a couple new questions that need editing, but first, clean up some older questions, then edit the new ones to put them back on top.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe slow and steady will win this race.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Identify other meta tags** - I'm sure there are more.  For new nominations, please put them in an answer (1 per) to allow debate.  If we get consensus, we'll edit them in here on the question and open season on them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Removed meta-tags:&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;I'm deleting the answers for the below to focus attention on the open discussions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[tag:two-players] suggested by Shujaa&#xD;&#xA;[tag:setup] suggested by bwarner&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/80/40" />

Now I agree that they're not good questions, so I'll try to use them as a context for my answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Bad question 1: What's a good game for 5 players? (Frequently seen with: Community wiki! One question per answer, please!) This is extremely subjective.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - Bad question 2: What games can you play with 5 players?

It's objective, but it's a database query, not a good Q&amp;A question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For both of these you can do a [Board Game Geek (BGG) search](http://boardgamegeek.com/geeksearch.php?action=search&amp;advsearch=1&amp;objecttype=boardgame&amp;q=&amp;include%5Bdesignerid%5D=&amp;geekitemname=&amp;include%5Bpublisherid%5D=&amp;geekitemname=&amp;range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D=&amp;range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D=&amp;range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D=&amp;floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=&amp;floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=&amp;range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D=&amp;floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D=&amp;floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D=&amp;range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D=&amp;searchuser=&amp;range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D=5&amp;range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D=5&amp;playerrangetype=normal&amp;range%5Bplayingtime%5D%5Bmax%5D=&amp;B1=Submit) and sort by ranking. In the event that you're looking for a field that's not recorded in BGG's database then you could head to their forums ([BGG: Gateway Board Games](http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/9937/gateway-board-games)). BGG is a site for discussion and opinions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Good question 1: What is a &quot;5-player&quot; game? Okay, so this *particular* question isn't great because it's so obvious, but the type of question is good: terminology. The original &quot;What is a Gateway Game&quot; question is an example of this type. It's a good question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Good question 2: Five can&#xD;&#xA;   be a difficult number of players to find a good game for. You can't&#xD;&#xA;   have even teams, and turn-based games can feel slow unless turns are short. What characteristics can a turn-based game have so that it doesn't feel too slow with 5 people?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A good answer for this last question should cite some games (after all, answer from experience!), but specific games should not be the answer. For example, games like Dixit or Apples to Apples have have everyone involved on every turn, 7 Wonders uses simultaneous drafting so that people are taking their turns at the same time, and Citadels has very short turns, many of which have some interaction and suspense for everyone. But the examples are just that, they provide back-up for the main points of the answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

There a lot of things that can be qualified as &quot;list questions&quot;. But only some of them are unacceptable and don't entirely work. Even your examples in #2 I wouldn't consider the problem to necessarily be that they are a list, but perhaps one of scope. As for unacceptability, I refer to [this post of mine that bwarner linked already](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/997/handling-game-recommendations-how-can-we-solve-these-two-problems-of-quality) as a good starting read.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the problem you're trying to determine here seems to be more about when there are multiple possible answers to a question, and not that it is an endless repository of options. Let's lay down some ground points then.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **It is perfectly acceptable for there to be more than one correct answer to a question**. This is why we even have a voting system at all, and why we allow multiple answers. This does not mean that &quot;Of these three cards, which is the best for a drain deck?&quot; should have three answers, though.&#xD;&#xA; 2. **If the answer a question needs is a list, then the list should fit in one answer**. An example I use from Arqade is &quot;Where do I find all of the subtanks in Megaman ZX?&quot;. There are exactly four of these - a proper answer will list all four. This should not get four answers, one for each location.&#xD;&#xA; 3. **The word &quot;best&quot; in a title is not an instant condemnation sign**. Implicitly, any question asking for the solution to a problem is seeking the best solution to that problem. A question whose core is still fully legitimate, just the presence of the word &quot;best&quot; is irksome, that is still a legitimate question. This does not mean that this question should get a separate answer for every possible best option, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's a resonating point that I made in all of these. Which is that a lot of questions will benefit a lot more from a comprehensive answer that covers multiple points, than one that just covers a single one. The conclusion can still be a single one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let us look at your two examples.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is the best spell for a multiplayer drain deck, Drain Life, Exsanguinate, or Bond of Agony&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A great answer to this question will cover all three cards, explain the advantages to each one, and either come to a conclusion of a single card being more universally useful or a conclusion on which scenarios will make which cards shine. A good answer will highlight one card and explain why it is more useful than the other two. A meh answer will just name a card and notate why it is good. A bad answer will just name one card.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there opinion? Yes, but the more opinionated an answer is, the less helpful an answer is. The more fundamental and fact-backed an answer is, the more useful it is to other people and thus the more rated it will be. What makes this still a helpful question is that there still *is* the room for fact-backed answers. At least, in theory. I don't know these cards so I have no idea, but my assumption is that the root question is as such.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is the best spell for a multiplayer drain deck?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As we start cutting things down, what's happening is that the scope is losing helpfulness. When you reach this point, an asker should be thinking, &quot;Is the answer too situational for this question to be helpful to others?&quot; I don't know drain decks well, but for example, &quot;What is the best set of Slivers for a Sliver deck?&quot; is too broad. Sliver deck is a strategy, certainly, but it also makes use of other strategies. Do you go Shadow/Poison and go for direct player kill? Do you go stat-stacking and overwhelm by Power/Toughness monstrosities? The reason Slivers work is because you have a lot of options that all work with a core theme.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this illustrates my point well enough. It's been too long since I played a deck that I know an example that isn't too broad. But the basic point is, you don't need to specify &quot;What is the best out of these options&quot; and can instead opt for &quot;What are the best options for this strategy?&quot; if the latter question is narrow enough in scope that the answers will be genuinely helpful. This can be the case even if there is more than one opinion on the answer - the ultimate core of the question is &quot;How can I accomplish this strategy?&quot;, which you'll note the lack of &quot;best&quot; but it will still get the same answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is the best black multiplayer spell?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is when it obviously gets to be too broad. I don't think I need to cover this in more depth beyond what I said in the previous point. At this point, though, the scope is so large that it illustrates the problem most people think of with lists. That is, because there isn't a narrow guideline, all people have to go on in answering this is their opinions. Factual stricture like saying &quot;Well, for this strategy, the best option is...&quot; starts to get away from the question that was actually asked. Which, while the answer is useful, it doesn't handle the question itself. That makes the question bad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Takeaway. If it invites a list, that doesn't make it bad. If the list isn't useful because it's too broad, that is a problem. If the list isn't useful because the scope makes a non-opinionated answer difficult to spring up properly, that is a problem. But if there's multiple options and perspectives to solve a problem, it can still be a valid question. I recommend [this post I wrote](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/1617/so-what-actually-is-a-game-rec/1841#1841) as just some further reading on the subject of this specifically." />

I find all of them factually dubious, and in any case you are ignoring the reasons why the BCG rules were created in the first place.

The problem with those sorts of questions is, that the don't fit the stack exchange Q&amp;A format:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Open recommendations result in long lists, with no definitive answer. (i.e. What is a good game for 3 players)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Open recommendations quickly become out of date, and are difficult to maintain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - They are too localized (i.e. What is a better game [for me] Risk or Axis&amp;Allies?)&#xD;&#xA; - They become a poll of not necessarily the best answer, but the most popular answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are other resources on the net that can provide better answers for these sorts of questions.

SE users are also free to ask for suggestions in chat, which they should be directed to. There, they can be prodded to provide more information that would be necessary to pin down which games would be best for them.&#xD;&#xA;" />

It's been too long, so no promises!&#xD;&#xA; - [Shark][19] (Ravensburger ed):  I dug this game out of storage to [answer a question][20] on this site.  Next time, you can have this pleasure!  Actually this is a pretty cool game.&#xD;&#xA; - [Lost Worlds][21] collection:  I have about 12 books, most still shrink wrapped.  You get them all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the 3 winners could drop me an email at havoc@boldo.com that would be great.  Include your postal address and the top 3 choices and I'll get them in the mail as soon as I can.  If I don't hear from you in a couple days I may not be able to get your game to you until after Christmas, things are getting busy around here!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks again to everyone!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Folks, it's go time!**&#xD;&#xA;====&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The six weeks between mid December and the end of January have been **very** good to us over the last couple years.  How good? Try 2x!  Visits have doubled during each of those periods.  Better yet, we've kept that level of traffic each year and continued to build upon it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see Christmas is being held again this year so I have no reason to suspect that it won't happen again!  That gives us 60 days to put our best foot forward.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Goal&#xD;&#xA;====&#xD;&#xA;Get launched!  Take a look at all of the [StackExchange sites][1] sorted by traffic.  At a high level I notice a couple things&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Above 5k visits/day most sites are launched&#xD;&#xA; - Below 4.5k visits/day most sites are not launched&#xD;&#xA; - Our traffic is currently 2.3k visits/day&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I haven't spoken to and SE staff about this, but it looks like that if our traffic can double we will be right in the sweet spot where the question switches from, &quot;When are we going to launch?&quot; to &quot;Why aren't we launched already?&quot;  **I'd like to force the question, who's with me?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sounds good, what can we do now?&#xD;&#xA;====&#xD;&#xA;Here are my ideas, please comment and expand!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Vote early, vote often!&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;One slightly disturbing trend I've noticed this year is a decrease in voting.  Since the end of January we've increased traffic by 2x.  Unfortunately, during that time, voting has decreased by 50%.  Taken together votes per visit was 4x higher at the beginning of the year.  I think we can do better, lets reward people that contribute to this site by asking good questions and giving great answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note - *I'm not encouraging anyone to blindly upvote everything they come across.*  Take a moment, evaluate the question or answer and then up **or** down vote appropriately.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Badges:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Electorate][2]: One of the easiest gold badges to receive.&#xD;&#xA; - [Sportsmanship][3] - Vote for answers that aren't yours.  Only one person with this hard to get silver badge.&#xD;&#xA; - [Vox Populi][4] - a copper badge that only 13 people have.  Anyone can obtain this with one day's worth of voting.  As a bonus, if you haven't got [Suffrage][5] yet, you'll obtain that as well!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Challenge* - Can we double the number of people that have these badges by the end of the year?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Spread the Word!&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not everyone has great social media connections, as I well know!  That doesn't mean we shouldn't try.  Share an occasional link on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, etc.  I think it works best if you share one that you were involved in or that helped you directly so that you can relate your personal experiences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're active on [Reddit][6] or similar sites, go ahead and drop a link where appropriate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Badges:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Announcer][7] - Bronze, we only have 14 of these.&#xD;&#xA; - [Booster][8] - Silver, we have but 2&#xD;&#xA; - [Publicist][9] - Gold, we have 1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Challenge* - Booster and Publicist are pretty hard, but can we double the Announcers?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Improve/Elaborate/expand&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Editing is a largely thankless task.  Fortunately we have many people who have been eager to improve posts, even ones that aren't their own.  Of course there is always more we can do.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of our hits come right from Google.  This means that people are ending up here looking for answers to their questions.  *This is awesome*, we have to make sure they get the information they need and hopefully plant a seed of curiosity that will bring them back here when they have a question they can't find the answer to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe that almost any post can be improved.  While fixing spelling and obvious grammar problems have significant value, we stand to gain a lot more when a good editor strips a post down and rebuilds it in a clear, concise manner.  I encourage everyone who may enjoy this to give it a try.  Turnover on our front page isn't too fast and almost every edit will have other people looking at it quickly.  If there's a problem, any edit can be reverted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Badges**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Copy Editor][10], 500 edited posts is a lot, I'm only a bit over half way there.  Can anyone beat me to it?&#xD;&#xA; - [Excavator][11] - a reward for one act of helping out an older post.&#xD;&#xA; - [Proofreader][12] - review other's edits.&#xD;&#xA; - [Research Assistant][13] - help out our tag wikis&#xD;&#xA; - [Strunk and White][14] - Edit 80 posts.  3 have been earned.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Challenge* - 20 more Excavators, double the Proofreaders, S&amp;W.  Get at least 2 Research Assistants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do I win?&#xD;&#xA;=====&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A better site for Board &amp; Card Games.  The more traffic we have, the better the answers will get.  We'll also get more questions and some of them will be more interesting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Making the world a better place.  Several times over the last year I've googled questions and ended up right back here.  People all over the world are doing this on a daily basis.  A lot of them end up here and get quick, great answers to their questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Games!** - Yes, I'll be giving away at least one game.  If you earn one of the badges mentioned above by December 15th @ midnight CST you will be entered to win a game from my personal collection.  I'll spend up to $25 shipping it to you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also listed 3 challenges above.  For each challenge that is achieved in the same period I'll add another game to the pot.  There could be a maximum of 4 winners (1 game each).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other rules&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Rules can change at any time at my discretion. The only rule that can't change is that I will give away one game to a member of this site.&#xD;&#xA; 1. Winner(s) to be determined at my discretion.  This will likely involve me rolling dice at my desk. **There may be no independent verification of results.**&#xD;&#xA; 1. Each person can only win one game&#xD;&#xA; 1. Achieving Silver or Gold badges improves your odds of winning.&#xD;&#xA; 1. Anyone who gets a mod message from the other mods will be disqualified.  IE - don't game the system, earn the badges legitimately.&#xD;&#xA; 1. If SE staff object to this &quot;contest&quot;, I'll end it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/28/electorate&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/58/sportsmanship&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/67/vox-populi&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/57/suffrage&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/54/announcer&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/55/booster&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/56/publicist&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/33/copy-editor&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/73/excavator&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/70/proofreader&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/79/research-assistant&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/12/strunk-white&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/53953/thunderstone&#xD;&#xA;  [16]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/823/lord-of-the-rings&#xD;&#xA;  [17]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3484/armada&#xD;&#xA;  [18]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1927/munchkin&#xD;&#xA;  [19]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/433/shark&#xD;&#xA;  [20]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/266/game-end-in-shark&#xD;&#xA;  [21]: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1421/lost-worlds" />

Neither has any real content. One happens to actually be a better solution than the other, but a naive reader cannot know that from the answer!

One of the results is that, for many questions, the name of the game is the only appropriate tag. Glancing at the questions on the front page shows a lot of questions with only one tag (and a few that have two, for a base game and expansion).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;MCeley then has an excellent point: if a new user asks a question about a new game, the form requires that it have at least one tag, but what should it be? Something general, like &quot;strategy&quot; is a now-frowned-upon meta tag. The name of the game hasn't been created yet, so a new user can't use it, I think a [tag:retag] tag is a good solution. My guess is most [tag:retag]s won't last more than 30 minutes before someone creates the appropriate tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My biggest concern is that new users won't know to use the [tag:retag], and I'd go so far as to ask for an additional feature request: a note on the Ask Question page for users unable to create tags instructing them of this convention." />

The Stack Exchange approach has been to &quot;try it and see&quot;: proposals are made at [Area 51][3], people try and refine scope, and if they reach critical mass, they launch. Importantly, these proposals, and the subsequent implemented sites, *need not be distinct sets*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, a question about the programmer's text editor [Vim][4] might be on topic on [Stack Overflow][5], [Unix and Linux][6], and [Ask Ubuntu][7]. This is because knowledge in the real world has fuzzy boundaries, and doesn't fit into a strict hierarchy, as ontologists and the field of AI has [come to learn the hard way][8], over a period of many years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Board and Card Games itself has overlap. We allow questions about computer implementations of board games, even though these are also on topic at [Arqade][9]. We also overlap with the [Poker][10], [Chess][11] and [Go][12] sites (the later now defunct, and merged with B&amp;CG). There is significant disagreement within the SE community about whether or not these distinct sites are necessary, what we gain or lose by merging, etc. etc. There are no easy answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the real question is **what does a site's scope gain us**? The key here is *community*. You want a critical mass of quality contributors who can ask and answer questions well, so that the site can become self-sustaining, while generating high-quality content.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In your question you define three broad areas of game, and imply that there isn't much overlap between them. I disagree. People that like board games often play many different kinds of games. Take a look at the answers of our top contributors to see that demonstrated. The connecting thread here is the *gaming* - how to define interesting problems or representations of the world, and how to solve them well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We make a distinction with video games, because the nature of the gaming, and the community, is completely different. We make a distinction with roleplaying, because while there is a fuzzy boundary, the big concerns of serious open-ended roleplaying games are significantly different (e.g. character development, immersiveness, creativity) from most board games.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Vocal communities for [tag:Chess], [tag:Poker], [tag:Go], and even [tag:Magic-the-gathering] have all argued that they are '*special*', that their game is particularly deep, that they are largely uninterested in other board games, and that experts will shun a site which does not exclusively cater to their game.

We all have our niches. On Stack Overflow, I only care about the two or three programming languages I use regularly. On Arqade, I completely ignore questions about Xbox games. I don't have the console, I can't answer them, and they aren't relevant to me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, I'll note that site scope is a work in progres. It's meta discussions here that help us to define what is and isn't acceptable, and that definition can and will evolve over time. For now, I see no argument for increased specificity.

I would expect a healthy amount of answers/question to be between 1-2 and dependant upon the ratio of rules questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**5 of expected 15 questions / day, Isn't that inviting to fluff questions?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately yes it probably does. Do not feel tempted to ask fluff questions. The biggest mistake we can make as a community is to increase the number of poor question or answers to make the arbitrary site metrics look good.&#xD;&#xA;" />

It's not actively bad and, as user 1873 said, a lot of our questions do have a single canonical answer (e.g. a quote from the rulebook or author -- though some of these questions definitely do have room for multiple answers just because of differences in how you *explain* the rules).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we really want to increase the number of answers per question (e.g. if it starts to dip significantly), my advice is to write questions that go deeper than a rule reference.

Just because the [metric expects 2.5 answers per question][1] *does not* mean we should add unnecessary extra answers to questions! These are just aggregate broad-brush metrics, and they are inherently limited.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you point out, there are a couple of ways to view wrong answers. A wrong answer that *looks right* can be actively harmful if a reader took away the impression that it was correct. On the other hand, a wrong answer that is subtle or easy to arrive at has value in being present, since it marks the common error. There are also gradations; sometimes an answer is *mostly right*, or only right under common circumstances, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From a site mechanic perspective, the intention seems to be to encourage deletion. If you leave a wrong answer up it will tend to be downvoted, accrue challenging comments, and so on, which you may not enjoy. There are also two badges ([Disciplined][2] and [Peer Pressure][3]) which explicitly reward you for deleting answers when you believe they aren't helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*However*, in this case I think the answer is very subtle. It was clear that most people thought you were correct, until the other answer showed up with the official ruling. In this situation, I think you would do best to edit your answer to indicate that you are aware it is incorrect, but that it is nevertheless a common misconception (you can point out exactly why as well, if you like). That should protect you from further downvotes while preserving a useful piece of information for the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately though, it's up to you.

Adding chess and poker to the mix would certainly help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Could we move closer to getting out of beta by &quot;repatriating&quot; chess and poker, as we did with go?" />

But I don't think every question can easily be asked _as_ a question, and we're not playing Jeopardy: I _don't_ think that 'phrase in the form of a question' is such an essential element of the question-asking process to be worth either changing out a user's post from under them (while it's true that users should be prepared to 'lose control' of their questions when they post them up here, that doesn't mean that it should be a matter of course) or of sweeping through the site's entire history revising everything.  This site isn't generating a ton of fresh content, and it's very easy for 'actually' (relatively) new questions to get lost in the swath of edited items; by my tally almost 2/3rds of the 'front page' of the site right now is auto-bumps, either from editing to the form of a question or from Community bumping up unanswered items." />

Before my little editing spree (which was probably a result of too much coffee), they would have been presented with a mishmash of questions, statements, and somewhere in between. Assuming they don't immediately read the FAQ (since most people who stumble here probably don't), they may see this organization as indicative of a forum rather than a Q&amp;A site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The initial thought when seeing &quot;Elegantly increasing the difficulty of Elder Sign&quot; isn't going to be &#xD;&#xA;&gt;*this is a question about how to do that with some potential answers supported by facts*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; but probably more along the lines of &#xD;&#xA;&gt;*this is going to be where we can talk about how to do that.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Editing titles into questions would help make this more clear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It probably isn't pertinent to go back and edit old titles into questions. However, if something shows up on the front page that isn't a question, my feeling is that it wouldn't be too much trouble to edit. With all threads being titled as questions, new users may have a better understanding of what they're looking at before getting to the point of reading the FAQ.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, in contrast to Steven, I think all posts on B&amp;CG should be able to be boiled down to a single question.

(I.e. is it more important to implement a strategy that is more difficult to implement (color &amp; rank counting), but has a greater effect on your win percentage (color counting). How should we rank strategies, only considering there effectiveness on winning?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would like to know **how** effective a strategy is on win percentages. I thought my [own answer](http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/12765/how-can-i-do-better-than-chance-in-uno/12776#12776) to the question gave some correct advice on how to increase your win percentage in UNO, but I couldn't quantify it without experimental verification. This is what lead me to [Stephen Davies UNO Simulator](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2012/davies-uno/). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A Java simulator program (provided) can simulate thousands of consecutive Uno! games in seconds. It implements all the rules of the standard game, including the scoring, with only one thing missing: pluggable strategy methods for each player. Students have two weeks to formulate their strategies and write their code for choosing a (legal) card to play from a hand, and choosing which color to &quot;call&quot; if they play a wild.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I decided to actually try implementing some different strategies too determine how effective they were. I tried **call** random color, color I have, color I have most of, color with most points, and **play** strategies with similar algorithms versus each other and the dominant strategy included in the software package **rbrown4** (a card counting algorithm, with some card weighting based upon hand sizes. I found that there was little difference between the card counter and just playing a random playable card, and calling a color you actually have (less than 5% in a 3-player game), but I also discovered some issues with the simulator.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Random isn't random enough: A proper pseudo random number generator (PRNG) needs a period larger than the possible game states.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The rules weren't implemented correctly: The simulator tracks points won per hand, not wins from acquiring 500 points. Draw cards played when going out don't add those drawn cards to your point total when you go out. Starting card effects are not allowed. Draw-4 wilds are allowed to be played when you have a playable color (and no &quot;caught&quot;/bluff is implemented)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The game state doesn't track the most useful variables: I would like to track cards played by a player, how close they are to 500 points, what colors/ranks they have drawn on, etc. but the current implementation leaves much of this information inaccessible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have corrected most of these issues and rerun the simulator with improved results. Previously when playing random cards and calling random colors would only result in a difference of about 10% points versus a card counter/most color strategy, the win percentage increased by 30% in a 3-player game (versus 2 random players). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Should I ask a new question focused exclusively on how effective each strategy is?** (or should I edit the original question to clarify what is meant by **most important** strategy?)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**If I ask a new question, how should I word it?** - I am interested to see how effective strategies like **always change a called color** are, but can that strategy be singled out in a vacuum? (I.e. should its effectiveness on win percentage be measured against a random player, or a most color player, etc.) Should I wait until I correct the errors in the UNO simulation and publish the results to SourceForge (or somewhere else)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

For instance, a guild hall offers four VPs and a large indigo plant two VPs. But if you own them together, you earn an extra VP for owning the guild hall plus the indigo plant (a production building). That's a total of seven instead of six VPs.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That, to me, addressed the key point of the question (about &quot;interaction&quot; effects), that the other, mostly excellent answer, had left out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's true that the earlier versions were less clear. But the criticism from one particular user began as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;are you trying to pollute BG.SE with poor quality questions and answers... Providing lots of low quality questions/answers is a very slow way to build up reputation.&quot; &#xD;&#xA; 	&#xD;&#xA;In the &quot;...&quot; was a more conventional critique about how this post was downvoted because it was redundant, factually incorrect, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I understand it, the purpose of commenting and downvoting is to point out errors, and encourage the OP to improve. That's something I welcome because I have an honest interest in learning the game. I did my best to improve that, and other posts critiqued by this user.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But was the first part of the critique using &quot;pollute&quot; appropriate for the site?

In the [original discussion][1] where we set our site boundaries, Brian Campbell's excellent post explicitly argued in favour of games based on luck or randomisation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For the first category, I think that solitaire games are on topic,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; while puzzles (such as Sudoku or crosswords) are off topic. But how to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; distinguish solitaire games from puzzles? I believe the criterion&#xD;&#xA;&gt; would be that solitaire games essentially produce an endless or large&#xD;&#xA;&gt; variety of different puzzles through randomization (most solitaire&#xD;&#xA;&gt; card games involve just shuffling a deck of cards, solitaire or coop&#xD;&#xA;&gt; games might involve rolling dice or other forms of randomization),&#xD;&#xA;&gt; while puzzles are static and new puzzles in a particular category&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (such as Sudoku or crosswords) must be created by another person or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; computer. I would, however, say that questions about puzzles that are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; specifically related to a board or card game, and commonly used in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; training for playing board and card games, would be OK; for instance,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I'm working on this chess problem, and the book lists this solution,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; but I just can't figure out why this other line of play doesn't work.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My opinion is that games which are completely luck-based are fine to ask about. Although strategy and tactics are non-existent, there are still reasonable questions about rules, probabilities, differences between editions, history, terminology, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By their nature, questions on these games will tend to be rarer, but that's fine too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At some level the off-topic dividing line is arbitrary. All games fall somewhere on the continuum between pure skill and pure luck. If pure luck games are excluded, what about games that are *almost* entirely luck? In other words, there is no *a priori* reason to ban these questions; explicitly denying one end of the spectrum is unnecessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/174/if-you-cant-sit-down-at-a-table-and-play-it-its-not-a-board-or-card-game-go/180#180" />

I can see how vaugue questions like &quot;I like Settlers of Catan. What would be a good game to buy next&quot; are basically a popularity poll and have little value, as we couldnt really rate answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But there are recommendation questions that make sense. I feel [mine][1] was one of them. I was **very** specific. I pinpointed the mechanics/game dynamics I disliked. I stated what do I consider a game similar to Eclipse. **This leaves room for easy evaluation of answers** suggesting some games as the solution of my problem. Does the game fix the issues I find in Eclipse? What mechanic is supposed to do that and how? Does the game fufill the requirements of being similar to Eclipse that I posted? **The specificity of my question eliminates the answer flood problem** - if there were so many games meeting my criteria, why would I even bother asking? Lets not ie to ourselves here - using the BGG mechanics search engine I had trouble finding games I know well and know percisely what mechanics they use. And im quite a tech savvy guy, being a programmer and all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cutting out the rules lawyering part, almost everything on the topic of boardgames is subjective. Some design solutions in a game may influence the gameplay experience of different individuals in different ways. Everything in a game depends on our perception. One might say Race for the Galaxy is solitaire, others might find a lot if indirect interaction in it. Can we objectively discuss design solutions used in the game? Not really.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack exchange started as stackoverflow, and many of the faq's and rules are a modified copy of stackoverflows faq's and rules. While for SO they work fine, they are not the best choice for all topics. Take programmers SE! Take Role playing games beta! Take parenting SE! All these could be argued to be totally subjective, but they worked out their own sets of rules and they are functional!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also disagree with @user1873 comment on how BGG is better suited for game recommendations. Well, for the ultra broad ones, like the &quot;Settlers...&quot; example i gave earlier, that might be true. But for qeustions that are concrete enough to have answers that can objectively be rated? I dont think so. Asking on BGG I'd have to dig through 200+ answers, most of which would be clueless, jokes or off-topic chatter. SE format would spare me that and leave me just the few best answers at the top, each a enclosed whole, not referring to what someone said 37 pages earlier in the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the argumentation provided in the link to the Arcade SE site...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; First, Repositories are often non-finite; many will continue to be updated as new information comes up. Building from that, Repositories also tend to be non-static; the other question classes have a far less frequent rate of change over time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;well guess what... Most questions on StackOverflow have exactly the same problem! With new technologies showing up at every corner, questions on how to deal with a specific problem will indeed raise a list of answers, each proposing the usage of the new, cool and shiny tool. As the tools proliferate, so will technically correct answers. Some will get outdated, others wont. Taking it all into account, we still see that StackOverflow is doing pretty well, right? And lots of other concerns about the &quot;repository&quot; thing look like problems with the answers not following any discipline, and not the questions being bad themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There is no motivation to excel and be an expert in building Repositories here. Otherwise, these Repositories should be filled to the brim with pages upon pages of contributions. So we are really just providing a small subset of qualifying content, namely the subjectively and currently popular content. Including myself, there are many people who continue to state that game recommendations can be founded on knowledge and that there exists expertise, but these past two months have shown quite clearly that nobody seems to care about making a good quality repository that is founded on knowledge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sooo... we only accept questions that are easy to answer in the correct way instead of fighting to have good answers to all questions?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, I would like to point out that our field is quite different form computer games. In boardgames, you directly interact with the games inner workings, and its a LOT easier to intelligently discuss them. We can for example reasonably compare games of the same genere, while in computer games it would probably get reduced to &quot;which game looks better or has a cooler storyline!&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do agree that it is quite easy to wirte a bad recommendation question, but I feel there is a knee-jerk reaction to recommendation questions. Something like &quot;So your looking for a game that... wait wiat. Alert! Alert! Vote close!&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am fully aware I wont sway your opinions, but I wanted to express what I think and state my point of view.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/13468/less-amerithrash-eclipse-alternatives" />

Questions are a Q&amp;A site's life blood (unsurprisingly), so we elected to hold off on graduating the site to make sure we weren't about to witness a precipitous drop-off in the number of questions being asked. Basically, we needed to make sure the core community here wasn't going to drop off. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In all other ways, the site seems like it is ready for graduation and elections.

I've never noticed this spam text behaviour before, because as Jefromi's test shows, mods don't see the replacement text.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I completely agree that this answer is not spam. In fact, I didn't act on the spam flag. The post triggered a deluge of flags - 4x 'not an answer', 2x 'very low quality', 1x 'spam', and 1x 'invalid flags'. From a moderator point of view, all of these are bundled together, and appear as a single &quot;flagged post&quot; that needs attention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When a post has multiple flags, I go and look at the full context of the page to decide what to do. Although not spam, I agreed that this was so useless that it could be deleted. A side-effect of taking action by hitting 'delete' is that all the flags are automatically marked as 'helpful', and, presumably because of the presence of the spam flag, the spam-hiding text was introduced.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* This was not deleted *because* it was spam. &#xD;&#xA;* I wasn't aware that spam flags changed the view of deleted answers for high-rep users.&#xD;&#xA;* The auto-marking of flags, while normally a very handy automatic step, in this case did more than was intended." />

The most current example is &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/1456/who-is-your-favourite-game-designer&quot;&gt;Who is your favourite game designer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, to some extent I sympathise with the problem the moderators face. You don't necessarily want to just close these questions without any community support, lest you face the accusation that you are being too heavy-handed or authoritarian. You may expect the community to eventually deal with the question. However, in the interim, the question continues, people get points, and it seems unfair. Or maybe you just have a more liberal outlook on subjective questions, and feel that more site content is basically a positive thing. So, CW, and where's the harm?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this situation, it may seem reasonable to convert the question to community wiki. No one gets any rep any more, the close votes can continue to accrue, and if the community feels strongly enough, it will eventually be shut. Also, on Stack Overflow, there is a history of users pressuring others to convert subjective questions to CW, normally with the threat of close votes if they do not comply (the so-called 'Wiki police'). This is a norm that many users feel they understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are four problems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjective questions are not inherently evil. But they are much harder to write well. Most of them are poor questions, and should not exist. This is described in detail in the blog post &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Good Subjective, Bad Subjective&lt;/a&gt;. This is official Stack Exchange policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Converting a post to CW requires moderator intervention. It therefore sends out a strong signal. It says &quot;I am a moderator on this site, and I think this question is ok, because I haven't stopped it, and in fact I am encouraging it to exist.&quot; This is harmful. Most users are not very experienced with the Stack Exchange engine, and they are looking for guidance about community norms. This sends the message &quot;lousy questions are fine, as long as a mod can stop by and fix them up with CW.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community Wiki was recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/392/should-the-community-wiki-police-be-shut-down/7183#7183&quot;&gt;banished for all normal users&lt;/a&gt;. Why was this done? Why can only moderators set the CW flag? It happened to avoid exactly this situation - weak questions being protected from closure by the nullifying of reputation gains. CW was originally intended &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for the situation where you have an answer, and would like to explicitly dilute your ownership, and encourage the community to improve it. It is a signal that says 'this content is jointly owned - please improve it'. The reputation feature is just a side-effect. Preventing reputation increases is &lt;em&gt;not the purpose&lt;/em&gt; of community wiki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no longer reasonable (if it ever was) to pressure users into making questions community wiki. This is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/392/should-the-community-wiki-police-be-shut-down&quot;&gt;official policy&lt;/a&gt;. The line is now much sharper; for almost all questions, they either should exist, or they should be closed. There is no CW limbo space. And it's not sufficient that a user request their question be wikified either; the reason for the CW needs to be clear and &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please can we stop hitting poor questions with the community wiki flag without careful thought?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" />

In fact, if you're a hardcore Magic player, you can follow that tag, &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/magic-the-gathering&quot;&gt;use that&lt;/a&gt; as your homepage, and just never see the rest of the site at all!

In your SO example, I think that's a key difference between &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%23-4.0&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'c#-4.0'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;c#-4.0&lt;/a&gt; and the non-existent &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%23-polymorphism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'c#-polymorphism'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;c#-polymorphism&lt;/a&gt; - the former is top-level, the latter is not.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tags should be as simple as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Tag conventions are great, but most users don't know or care about what they &quot;should&quot; be using. Most people would just tag &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bridge&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'bridge'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bidding&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'bidding'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;bidding&lt;/a&gt; and move on. Any policy that doesn't do what people expect needs to be considered carefully.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special conventions need maintenance.&lt;/strong&gt; The corollary to the previous point is that higher rep users will have to do more monitoring and retagging when non-obvious conventions are in use.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining game-specific tags is non-trivial.&lt;/strong&gt; How do you make the distinction between a tag that only applies to a single game, and one which is more general? It's impossible to guarantee that no other game has the concept of &quot;manabase&quot;. Even worse, they might have a similar mechanic, but call it something a bit different. Choosing where to draw that line with specialised tag naming is going to be endless.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One place where this might be a little different is the case of game expansions, and how they should be tagged. I'll bring that up in a separate question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best summary we have of how tagging is intended to work is &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/31776/why-do-we-tag-questions&quot;&gt;Why do we tag questions?&lt;/a&gt;.

It's true that the questions, being only tangentially related, should have been asked separately. And it's certainly true it won't be much help from a searching perspective in future. From that point of view, a vote to close seems appropriate. But it's also true that the question asker is new to the site, and can't be expected to know much about our Q&amp;amp;A system. Closing their question sends a strong signal, and can be perceived quite negatively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the OP shows willing to re-ask the questions, then that's fine. But for the community, there's no straightforward way to split his question, short of re-asking on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;for new users&lt;/em&gt;, I'm basically on the fence. I'm not going to take any action, since as a moderator, my vote to close would be binding. I think leaving a comment, as Pat did, was an excellent step. If the community really dislikes it, they can vote to close. At the end of the day, the OP got their answer, and may stick around. I think if we don't see any response from the OP, then closing this in a few days seems reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For reference, your question prompted me to ask a variant of this on the main meta: &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/120633/what-do-we-do-with-multiple-question-questions&quot;&gt;What do we do with &quot;multiple question&quot; questions?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" />

This SE blog encourages the community to follow 6 principles developed by the moms4mom group. Here are principals 4 and 5:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;4: Great subjective questions invite sharing experiences over&#xA;  opinions. Certainly experiences inform opinions, but the best&#xA;  subjective questions unabashedly and unashamedly prioritize sharing&#xA;  actual experiences over random opinions. It’s more useful to share&#xA;  with us what you’ve done than what you think. Everyone has an opinon.&#xA;  It takes zero effort or imagination to have an opinion about anything&#xA;  and everything. But people who have done things, real things in the&#xA;  world, and have the scars and arrows in their back to show for it —&#xA;  now that’s worth sharing. You should be uniquely qualified to have&#xA;  your opinion based on the specific experiences you had. And you should&#xA;  share those experiences, and more specifically what you learned from&#xA;  your experiences, with us!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;5: Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with&#xA;  facts and references. Opinion isn’t all bad, so long as it’s backed up&#xA;  with something other than “because I’m an expert”, or “because I said&#xA;  so”, or “just because”. Use your specific experiences to back up your&#xA;  opinions, as above, or point to some research you’ve done on the web&#xA;  or elsewhere that provides evidence to support your claims. We like&#xA;  you. We want to believe you. But like wikipedia itself, {{citation&#xA;  needed}}. And good subjective questions make this clear from the&#xA;  outset: back it up!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key phrase in #5 is &quot;Use your specific experiences to back up your opinions&quot; and the key phrase in #4 is &quot;the best subjective questions unabashedly and unashamedly prioritize sharing actual experiences over random opinions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we're to follow the guidelines suggested in this SE blog post, then it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make sense to cite one's experience as related to a question and its answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An introduction like &quot;Based on a few games I've designed and extensive play-testing where suitability for children was a common designer question, here's what I've learned . . .&quot; would seem to be in the spirit of describing one's actual experiences that the answer is based on. It may not be the optimal wording (feel free to suggest improvements).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But an introduction like this does help provide the experiential context for the answer, and that makes the answer better for questions of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" />

It is part of the duties of moderation.  The goal is to focus the site on awesome answers to great questions. People should not have to read and understand a bunch of comments to get to the meat of the answer.  This is the primary difference between SE and forums in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comments are ephemeral on this (indeed all) SE sites.  You should have no expectation of them lasting forevermore.  This has been stated quite clearly by Jeff Atwood, founder of StackExchange:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;not every user-generated byte committed to memory is sacred.

The primary goal is to generate a repository of good questions and helpful answers, not lengthy back-and-forth discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, I'll let comments live for 30 days.  After that they are prone to get considered for deletion when I see them.  If there is useful content in them that contributes to the question/answer, I'll leave them or roll them in (ideally this is an ongoing process).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Update in response to comments&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that I used, &quot;In general&quot; and &quot;considered for deletion&quot;  Despite comments to the contrary, I do not blanket delete all comments.  I feel that the vast majority of deleted comments any reasonable person would agree are not useful.  Examples &quot;+1 I agree&quot; or my favorite: &quot;Did you mean XX?&quot;/&quot;Yes&quot;/&quot;You should edit that in&quot;/&quot;Thanks, I just did&quot;/&quot;Great&quot;.

Sure, I am a semi-sentient bag of water and other people may have a different subjective opinion on various matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the original poster is not defending the deleted comment in question, I'd rather debate openly any &lt;strong&gt;other&lt;/strong&gt; example of a deleted comment that someone feels was really adding to the discussion.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" />

In fact, this was realised early on in the history of StackExchange. The idea of bumping questions that might need more eyeballs is explicitly implemented in one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19738/who-is-the-community-user&quot;&gt;functions of the Community User&lt;/a&gt;. If you take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;the homepage&lt;/a&gt;, it's usual to see several questions up there which were last edited by this &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community&quot;&gt;special user&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for how and when questions are automatically bumped, see for example the discussion here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99672/community-should-discriminate-more-when-bumping-unanswered-questions&quot;&gt;Community should discriminate more when bumping unanswered questions&lt;/a&gt;.

If there are too many old questions, or they aren't interesting to answerers (because perhaps they have been answered very well already), then these can have a negative impact on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know exactly what the rate of churn of old questions by the Community user is for our site, but in my opinion it seems reasonable. I don't particularly see any need to increase that. One of the things I'm most proud of with this site is that we have a very &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5220/board-and-card-games&quot;&gt;high answer rate&lt;/a&gt; of 98%, which suggests that most questions get a pretty good going over first time around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" />

There have been a few previous discussions on the subject of answer reproduction/incorporation (see the references at the end). In fact, way back in 2009, I even &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/17685/132073&quot;&gt;asked this question&lt;/a&gt; myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The broad consensus is that, in general, this kind of behaviour is positive, if done in a respectful way:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Legally, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CC license&lt;/a&gt; under which your contributions are made allows reuse, as long as &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/attribution-required/&quot;&gt;attribution is provided&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In terms of etiquette, clearly explaining that an answer makes use of another, and giving full credit to the source is usually sufficient. Both answers will probably accrue votes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is value to having a single, up-to-date answer which collates all aspects of the problem, and presents it in a consistent way.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;However, ripping off other people's answers wholesale and presenting them as your own is not ok.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stealing content from other people within the first few minutes of a post, when answers are jostling for position, is not acceptable, but unfortunately often hard to prove.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular example, the new content has arisen because of the introduction of 6th ed Warhammer rules. It's reasonable for the top answer to be revisited to deal with that. The author did cite you, but in my opinion could have made it much clearer that he was quoting you verbatim.

You really don't want to force people to do so.  My advice is just to not worry about it.  A few downvotes don't have any significant impact on your reputation.  Some people dislike answering a question that you asked.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/&quot;&gt;They're wrong&lt;/a&gt;, but there is nothing to stop them from voting that way.

Just because the &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5220/board-and-card-games&quot;&gt;metric expects 2.5 answers per question&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; mean we should add unnecessary extra answers to questions! These are just aggregate broad-brush metrics, and they are inherently limited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you point out, there are a couple of ways to view wrong answers. A wrong answer that &lt;em&gt;looks right&lt;/em&gt; can be actively harmful if a reader took away the impression that it was correct. On the other hand, a wrong answer that is subtle or easy to arrive at has value in being present, since it marks the common error. There are also gradations; sometimes an answer is &lt;em&gt;mostly right&lt;/em&gt;, or only right under common circumstances, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a site mechanic perspective, the intention seems to be to encourage deletion. If you leave a wrong answer up it will tend to be downvoted, accrue challenging comments, and so on, which you may not enjoy. There are also two badges (&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/19/disciplined&quot;&gt;Disciplined&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/20/peer-pressure&quot;&gt;Peer Pressure&lt;/a&gt;) which explicitly reward you for deleting answers when you believe they aren't helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, in this case I think the answer is very subtle. It was clear that most people thought you were correct, until the other answer showed up with the official ruling. In this situation, I think you would do best to edit your answer to indicate that you are aware it is incorrect, but that it is nevertheless a common misconception (you can point out exactly why as well, if you like). That should protect you from further downvotes while preserving a useful piece of information for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, it's up to you.

You can offer a carrot in the form of a comment that says &quot;wow, I'd love to vote this up if it was community wiki&quot; but downvoting and other nagging is not appropriate. (addendum: the community wiki flag checkbox is *not shown* for new users because they can't possibly understand it, you may potentially be nagging new users about a setting they don't even have.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. **If you think something should be community wiki then flag it for mod attention** with a comment to that effect. Simple.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, note that as of now the CW edit threshold has been reduced from 750 rep to 100 rep on all sites." />

The most current example is [Who is your favourite game designer?][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, to some extent I sympathise with the problem the moderators face. You don't necessarily want to just close these questions without any community support, lest you face the accusation that you are being too heavy-handed or authoritarian. You may expect the community to eventually deal with the question. However, in the interim, the question continues, people get points, and it seems unfair. Or maybe you just have a more liberal outlook on subjective questions, and feel that more site content is basically a positive thing. So, CW, and where's the harm?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this situation, it may seem reasonable to convert the question to community wiki. No one gets any rep any more, the close votes can continue to accrue, and if the community feels strongly enough, it will eventually be shut. Also, on Stack Overflow, there is a history of users pressuring others to convert subjective questions to CW, normally with the threat of close votes if they do not comply (the so-called 'Wiki police'). This is a norm that many users feel they understand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are four problems:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Subjective questions are not inherently evil. But they are much harder to write well. Most of them are poor questions, and should not exist. This is described in detail in the blog post [Good Subjective, Bad Subjective][2]. This is official Stack Exchange policy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Converting a post to CW requires moderator intervention. It therefore sends out a strong signal. It says &quot;I am a moderator on this site, and I think this question is ok, because I haven't stopped it, and in fact I am encouraging it to exist.&quot; This is harmful. Most users are not very experienced with the Stack Exchange engine, and they are looking for guidance about community norms. This sends the message &quot;lousy questions are fine, as long as a mod can stop by and fix them up with CW.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. Community Wiki was recently [banished for all normal users][3]. Why was this done? Why can only moderators set the CW flag? It happened to avoid exactly this situation - weak questions being protected from closure by the nullifying of reputation gains. CW was originally intended *only* for the situation where you have an answer, and would like to explicitly dilute your ownership, and encourage the community to improve it. It is a signal that says 'this content is jointly owned - please improve it'. The reputation feature is just a side-effect. Preventing reputation increases is *not the purpose* of community wiki.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. It is no longer reasonable (if it ever was) to pressure users into making questions community wiki. This is also [official policy][4]. The line is now much sharper; for almost all questions, they either should exist, or they should be closed. There is no CW limbo space. And it's not sufficient that a user request their question be wikified either; the reason for the CW needs to be clear and *valid*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please can we stop hitting poor questions with the community wiki flag without careful thought?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/1456/who-is-your-favourite-game-designer&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/392/should-the-community-wiki-police-be-shut-down/7183#7183&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/392/should-the-community-wiki-police-be-shut-down" />

A tag like [tag:bidding] isn't going to be used like that. In your SO example, I think that's a key difference between [tag:c#-4.0] and the non-existent [tag:c#-polymorphism] - the former is top-level, the latter is not.&#xD;&#xA;* **Tags should be as simple as possible.** Tag conventions are great, but most users don't know or care about what they &quot;should&quot; be using. Most people would just tag [tag:bridge] [tag:bidding] and move on. Any policy that doesn't do what people expect needs to be considered carefully.&#xD;&#xA;* **Special conventions need maintenance.** The corollary to the previous point is that higher rep users will have to do more monitoring and retagging when non-obvious conventions are in use.&#xD;&#xA;* **Determining game-specific tags is non-trivial.** How do you make the distinction between a tag that only applies to a single game, and one which is more general? It's impossible to guarantee that no other game has the concept of &quot;manabase&quot;. Even worse, they might have a similar mechanic, but call it something a bit different.

This SE blog encourages the community to follow 6 principles developed by the moms4mom group. Here are principals 4 and 5:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4: Great subjective questions invite sharing experiences over&#xD;&#xA;&gt; opinions. Certainly experiences inform opinions, but the best&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subjective questions unabashedly and unashamedly prioritize sharing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; actual experiences over random opinions. It’s more useful to share&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with us what you’ve done than what you think. Everyone has an opinon.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It takes zero effort or imagination to have an opinion about anything&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and everything. But people who have done things, real things in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; world, and have the scars and arrows in their back to show for it —&#xD;&#xA;&gt; now that’s worth sharing. You should be uniquely qualified to have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your opinion based on the specific experiences you had. And you should&#xD;&#xA;&gt; share those experiences, and more specifically what you learned from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your experiences, with us!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5: Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; facts and references. Opinion isn’t all bad, so long as it’s backed up&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with something other than “because I’m an expert”, or “because I said&#xD;&#xA;&gt; so”, or “just because”. Use your specific experiences to back up your&#xD;&#xA;&gt; opinions, as above, or point to some research you’ve done on the web&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or elsewhere that provides evidence to support your claims. We like&#xD;&#xA;&gt; you. We want to believe you. But like wikipedia itself, {{citation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; needed}}. And good subjective questions make this clear from the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; outset: back it up!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key phrase in #5 is &quot;Use your specific experiences to back up your opinions&quot; and the key phrase in #4 is &quot;the best subjective questions unabashedly and unashamedly prioritize sharing actual experiences over random opinions.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we're to follow the guidelines suggested in this SE blog post, then it *does* make sense to cite one's experience as related to a question and its answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An introduction like &quot;Based on a few games I've designed and extensive play-testing where suitability for children was a common designer question, here's what I've learned . . .&quot; would seem to be in the spirit of describing one's actual experiences that the answer is based on. It may not be the optimal wording (feel free to suggest improvements).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But an introduction like this does help provide the experiential context for the answer, and that makes the answer better for questions of this nature." />

Just because the [metric expects 2.5 answers per question][1] *does not* mean we should add unnecessary extra answers to questions! These are just aggregate broad-brush metrics, and they are inherently limited.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you point out, there are a couple of ways to view wrong answers. A wrong answer that *looks right* can be actively harmful if a reader took away the impression that it was correct. On the other hand, a wrong answer that is subtle or easy to arrive at has value in being present, since it marks the common error. There are also gradations; sometimes an answer is *mostly right*, or only right under common circumstances, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From a site mechanic perspective, the intention seems to be to encourage deletion. If you leave a wrong answer up it will tend to be downvoted, accrue challenging comments, and so on, which you may not enjoy. There are also two badges ([Disciplined][2] and [Peer Pressure][3]) which explicitly reward you for deleting answers when you believe they aren't helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*However*, in this case I think the answer is very subtle. It was clear that most people thought you were correct, until the other answer showed up with the official ruling. In this situation, I think you would do best to edit your answer to indicate that you are aware it is incorrect, but that it is nevertheless a common misconception (you can point out exactly why as well, if you like). That should protect you from further downvotes while preserving a useful piece of information for the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ultimately though, it's up to you.

That's why the deletion with those flags triggers that replacement text, to keep people from ever even seeing spam links or offensive content. The feature was [added in October][1]. It's *not* for hiding away silly/stupid/pointless/misguided non-answers; it doesn't trigger for the &quot;not an answer&quot; flag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So that answer? Not an answer. Whoever flagged it as spam was misusing the flag, and the text should not have been replaced.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately I think this is something only mods can address. If the answer is undeleted, the replacement text goes away, then it can be deleted again. They can also decline incorrect flags; [if the spam flags aren't marked as helpful, this feature won't be triggered][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(If you happen to be a mod, you can find deleted answers by searching for &quot;is:answer deleted:yes&quot; - I think you might find a few more this has happened to.

Currently, only two cards contain an ampersand character, and both of those cards also contain an apostrophe, so if the apostrophe issue can be fixed, then those two cards will still result in broken links unless the ampersand issue is also corrected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Most Other Characters Seem To Work OK ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have sampled other cards with special characters in the name, and discovered no other issues so far.  Examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[mtg:Kongming, &quot;Sleeping Dragon&quot;]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[mtg:Question Elemental?]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[mtg:B.F.M. (Big Furry Monster)]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[mtg:Alive (Alive/Well)] (This one does return two results, however; one for each half of the split card, as opposed to linking to the card itself, which should work like this instead: [Alive (Alive/Well)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=369041&amp;part=Alive)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It looks to me like the apostrophe is problematic for Gatherer's query engine because they are most likely not correctly escaping the character in their SQL strings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Is This Within Our Means To Fix? ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These issues seem to be a problem with Wizards of the Coast's API, and may not even be something that we can fix on our end, but if there is something that can be done about it, what might that be?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only sure way (presently) to generate a link to the exact card intended seems to be using a traditional link to the card's multiverse-ID-based page, for example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [Ranger's Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370803)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Notes ###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1] Interestingly enough, the symbol that you see in this link was typed in the editor as &quot;&amp;&quot;, but seems to be automatically changed, appending &quot;and;&quot; to the &quot;&amp;&quot;.  Might there be a way to have this kind of thing formatted to show just the ampersand and not the encoded version?  If the link actually uses an &quot;&amp;&quot;, it would produce a query of simply &quot;r&quot; (cutting off the ampersand itself and all following characters).  But if the link uses the concatenated &quot;&amp;&quot; + &quot;amp;&quot; that the auto-linker changes this to, Gatherer produces &quot;rampds secret lair&quot; as the query, which is also invalid." />

Is there a way that we can better encourage a new user to stay and ask his question in the correct way?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A couple possibilities:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Allow brand new users to leave comments. Many of the invalid answers are things that would work as comments to an answer, rather than a new question, but new users can't leave comments.&#xD;&#xA;2. Allow moderators to automatically convert answers to questions. I know they can convert answers to comments, but as far as I know they can't convert them to questions. I believe a new user would be more likely to stay if he actually had a question listed. Though I don't know if this is possible within the framework.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any other ideas?

This reimplementation includes the following features:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* A client-side Markdown extension to parse `[mtg:...]` links in the edit preview window.  (Based on the SE `[tag:...]` link parser, seems to closely match the server-side implementation.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* A delegated click event handler (to open the popup window) that works also in preview and for posts loaded via AJAX.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Scrollable and resizeable pop-up windows (because a lot of card pages are taller than 890 pixels).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* A customizable link URL, defaulting to `http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=...` as proposed in [my earlier post](http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/1156/2203).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* A client-side hotfix to make any server-side generated MtG card links use the new URL, and to fix the double-escaping bug described in the question above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* May be used as a drop-in replacement for the existing mtg.js script, or [installed](https://gist.github.com/vyznev/d497e93daecbce75a014/raw/2b8b5ba1d52fc77271863c198acf1b50fcb784d8/mtg_v2.user.js) as a Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey user script in the browser for immediate testing.  (*Note: Scrollable popup windows may not work for all card links when installed as a user script.*)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've released the code into the public domain, and would be very happy if the SE devs were to use it as a replacement of the existing mtg.js script.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(I'd be even happier if they also fixed the server-side code to use the new URL and to get rid of the double-escaping bug, which would allow the hotfix portion of the client-side code to be removed.)&#xD;&#xA;" />

In addition, kingmaking as a concept is of specific relevance to the playing of multiplayer, strategic, turn-based games. Most importantly, it's a question about *playing* games (or at least choosing rules for an optimal play experience)&#xD;&#xA; - Analysis paralysis is a general concept, but handling it in the context of board and card games is different than handling it in a workplace, for example. It's also a question about *playing* games. In addition, that question was written *the first day* the site existed, when topic boundaries were still being figured out.&#xD;&#xA; - Taking back actions, again, has specific relevance to people playing board and card games, especially in games with hidden information and especially in face to face games (where other players' reactions can be considered hidden information).

Within this broad field, a number of fairly distict subtopics may be recognized, such as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [**Combinatorial game theory**](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory), which studies sequential games of perfect information, such as Chess, Go or Tic-Tac-Toe.  These games are characterized by the property that they include no randomness or hidden information, and thus by the fact that, if all the players follow a perfectly optimal strategy (which must exist, in theory, even if it is not known), the outcome will always be the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **&quot;Classical&quot; game theory**, which assumes that all players are fully aware of each others' possible strategies and payoffs, but not necessarily of the specific moves others have chosen to make, and that they all choose their strategy independently to maximize their expected payoff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [**Cooperative game theory**](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game), which allows players to collude and form (more or less) binding coalitions through some kind of enforcement mechanisms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [**Evolutionary game theory**](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory), which replaces the assumption that players rationally choose their strategies with the assumption that they each follow a fixed hereditary strategy which they pass on, possibly with small mutations, to their offspring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point to note here is that *all* these subfields, and many more besides, fall under the broad umbrella term &quot;game theory&quot;.  In fact, pretty much *any* mathematical (or quasi-mathematical) analysis of games could be considered a part of game theory, except maybe for games of pure luck (which are traditionally considered to fall under probability theory, although some might see this distinction as more of a historical artifact than an actual qualitative difference).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the questions mentioned above, as a mathematician I would regard them all as falling under the scope of game theory, even if some of the answers here may not possess quite the level of mathematical rigor I would usually expect of a formal game-theoretical analysis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Specifically, the following questions ask about optimal (or quasi-optimal) strategies of sequential games of perfect information, and are thus **clearly within the scope of combinatorial game theory**:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/6060/is-circus-maximus-solvable&#xD;&#xA;* http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/7085/what-is-the-optimal-strategy-in-quantum-tic-tac-toe&#xD;&#xA;* http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/12477/is-ultimate-tic-tac-toe-solved&#xD;&#xA;* http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/17863/hex-game-strategy&#xD;&#xA;* http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/5470/what-are-the-main-results-in-game-theory-regarding-go&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The remaining two questions may not be about *combinatorial* game theory, but do seem to fall under the scope of classical game theory:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/7375/maximum-attainable-points-for-a-single-player-in-a-two-player-game-of-carcassonn might or might not be a combinatorial question (I'm not sure if the stated assumptions are enough to eliminate all the randomness and uncertainty from the game), but if not, is surely is within the scope of classical game theory.&#xD;&#xA;* http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/17957/whats-the-name-of-the-theory-that-the-player-with-the-most-options-has-the-adva, while somewhat confusingly written, essentially presents a claim about optimal strategies (namely, that expanding the strategy space for a player cannot reduce the value of the game for said player) and asks whether this claim is a known game-theoretical theorem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The *real* problems with the [tag:game-theory] tag here, IMO, are two-fold:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. several of the questions are simply not very good questions, or, even if the questions might be *potentially* interesting, are poorly asked; and&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. even the game-theory questions that *are* reasonably well asked seem to rarely get good answers on this site, presumably because we don't have many mathematicians (or people from related fields) here to answer them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Honestly, I suspect that several of these questions would've been better asked at [math.SE](http://math.stackexchange.com), or possibly at [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net).

Erebos, God of the Dead&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ok, but &quot;vs&quot; in what way? Can you tell what's going on between these two cards here? Probably not.

What do these two have to do with each other? Surely you can't use these _on each other,_ or something, right?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Why are Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale and Pendrell Mists worded differently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Much better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Should we generalise away the names enthusiastically? No.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Magic has lots of cards. Lots and lots. And there's only a small quantity of mechanics, so a lot of these cards look like some other cards, and a lot of questions about interactions between two cards or what one card does comes down to mechanics that have been explained before in some way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, here's the thing:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Most of the cards which are worth asking about are fairly unique, because of the *specific combination* of pre-existing mechanics on those cards: even two that reuse the exact same mechanical concepts can do so with different timing, ordering, numbers, targeting criteria, and so on and wind up completely different cards.&#xD;&#xA;* The interaction between two cards is often _very_ unique.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it's easy enough to generalise a question from:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* What about {thing} when I have Etherium Sculptor out?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;into&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* What about {thing} when I have a permanent out that makes artifacts cost 1 less?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;... except there's [very few cards like that](http://magiccards.info/query?q=o%3Aartifact+o%3Aspells+o%3Acost+o%3Aless+o%3Acast). Etherium Sculptor is one of them. (There are others, probably, that let me pick a type.) How likely is there going to _really_ be an exact duplicate for this situation? Unlikely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See this question?:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/13805/does-progenitor-mimic-create-copies-of-itself-even-when-it-isnt-a-creature&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are you going to rename this to something like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Can a creature which clones a creature then keeps creating copies of itself and refers to itself as a 'creature' in the description keep copying itself when it isn't a creature?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You probably won't, and there's a good reason for that: the title's absurd, you probably realise that, and there's still only one card that fits exactly this mechanical arrangement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another common mechanic is a `*/*` creature whose P/T depends on a count of certain cards in the graveyard. Except... [there's only close to 20 cards](http://magiccards.info/query?q=o%3Apower+o%3Atoughness+o%3A%22equal+to%22+o%3Acards+o%3Ain+o%3Agraveyard&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname) which have an ability kinda like that, most of them are subtly different from the rest in some way that's going to be *critical* to a question, and look! [mtg:Nighthowler] isn't even in that search, because it's subtly different in yet another way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## MTG answers necessarily involve revisiting the same mechanics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We're going to revisit and re-explain the same mecahnics as parts of answers over and over, but that's because MTG reuses the same mechanics over and over in different ways, and we need to revisit them each time to explain a card or its interaction with other cards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That doesn't make for good dupe candidates, though. It also doesn't mean replacing the name of a card with the description of its relevant mechanics is helpful. Especially if the resulting name is so weird I don't understand it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Stack Exchange encourages asking about specific problems, not generalisations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our [tour](http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/tour) says this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Focus on questions about an actual problem you have faced. Include details about what you have tried and exactly what you are trying to do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And our [don't ask help article](http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask) says this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By this guidance, this title:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Does Marchesa, the Black Rose protect herself as well as others from board wipes that would kill her too?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;is better than this title:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/18269/what-happens-when-a-creature-with-whenever-a-creature-dies-dies-simultaneously&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;because generalising it isn't helpful; this should be about the actual problem faced. The problem is: Will Marchesa save my creatures?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's very likely other cards with similar triggers will, again, be different from Marchesa, and this won't be a dupe, and even if both cards will react to others dying helpfully, they won't be duplicates because of something unique to the other situation being asked about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Let's just generalise where the question is absolutely general.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, this is overdoing it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I think that the community needs to be more aggressive about editing the titles of questions that contain almost purely card names unless they are absolutely unable to be generalized.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But this might be more helpful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ... if the situation and mechanic are extremely general and can be safely _very_ generalised.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like here!

We're not likely to get duplicates on this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Likewise, we could rename ***http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/13805/does-progenitor-mimic-create-copies-of-itself-even-when-it-isnt-a-creature*** to be more general. But what general title could we have? Something like: ***Can a creature which clones a creature then keeps creating copies of itself and refers to itself as a 'creature' in the description keep copying itself when it isn't a creature?*** That's sure more general, but there's still only one card this would even relate to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a recent concrete example, ***http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/18269/what-happens-when-a-creature-with-whenever-a-creature-dies-dies-simultaneously*** was recently retitled from ***Does Marchesa, the Black Rose protect herself as well as others from board wipes that would kill her too?***. Sure, we're revisiting the same mechanic again, and we're going to revisit them again another time, but this isn't actually likely to be a duplicate target because of the specific situation being asked about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Let's just generalise where the generalisation is absolutely helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, this is overdoing it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I think that the community needs to be more aggressive about editing the titles of questions that contain almost purely card names unless they are absolutely unable to be generalized.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But this might be more helpful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ... if the situation and mechanic are extremely general and can be safely _very_ generalised.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like here!

And look! [mtg:Nighthowler] isn't even in that search, because it's subtly different in yet another way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, even if I replace a card name in a title with a description of that relevant mechanic, it's unlikely I've suddenly made that question canon or a useful dupe target. Sometimes I will, but most often I won't. The next question that covers those mechanics is going to be asking about a different card, with a unique and critical difference, in a different situation, and it's not going to be a duplicate of this question even if the title's more generic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Generalising is often gainless&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I could ask a question titled ***What about {thing} when I have Etherium Sculptor out?***, or I could title it more generally with ***What about {thing} when I have a creature out that makes artifacts cost 1 less?***, except there's [very few cards like that](http://magiccards.info/query?q=o%3Aartifact+o%3Aspells+o%3Acost+o%3Aless+o%3Acast) and Etherium Sculptor is one of them.

But what general title could we have? Something like: ***Can a creature which clones a creature then keeps creating copies of itself and refers to itself as a 'creature' in the description keep copying itself when it isn't a creature?*** That's sure more general, but there's still only one card this would even relate to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a recent concrete example, ***http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/18269/what-happens-when-a-creature-with-whenever-a-creature-dies-dies-simultaneously*** was recently retitled from ***Does Marchesa, the Black Rose protect herself as well as others from board wipes that would kill her too?***.

I edit a lot of MTG questions. I value titles (they're what people see when browsing or using Google), and I edit a lot of questions primarily to give them a better title.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I think that the community needs to be more aggressive about editing the titles of questions that contain almost purely card names unless they are absolutely unable to be generalized.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not think we need to do this. I do not think it is a good idea, or that &quot;unless they are absolutely unable to be generalised&quot; is a good rule of thumb. I'll explain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Should we edit question titles that just mention two card names? Certainly!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When a question title consists of merely &quot;Card vs Card&quot; or &quot;Card and Card&quot; or so on, I'll edit the title to try to capture the interaction between those cards so as to communicate what the heck is going on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think it'll be contested that either of these retitles is better, because the &quot;vs&quot; says almost nothing about the situation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* ***Aegis of the Gods Vs. Erebos, God of the Dead*** &amp;rarr; ***Will Aegis of the Gods negate my opponent's Erebos, God of the Dead for me?***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* ***tabernacle of pendrell vale vs. pendrell mists*** &amp;rarr; ***Why are Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale and Pendrell Mists worded differently?***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So yeah, if the question is _just_ card titles, it's probably gonna be a good candidate for retitling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Should we generalise away the names enthusiastically? No.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, here's the thing. Magic has a lot of cards, and a limited quantity of mechanics. Each new card combines those mechanics in new and different ways. Two cards using the same five mechanical concepts could put them in a different order and adjust the numbers and wind up not resembling each other at all. On top of that, the combination of any two remarkable cards is often incredibly unique.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We do end up revisiting the same mechanics over and over in Magic the Gathering answers, but that's because they keep getting re-used. That doesn't mean one answer explaining those five mechanics can necessarily answer a question about the other card.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an example, consider the common mechanic of creatures with a P/T of `*/*`, where that's defined by cards in graveyards. How many cards do that? [Not many more than 20](http://magiccards.info/query?q=o%3Apower+o%3Atoughness+o%3A%22equal+to%22+o%3Acards+o%3Ain+o%3Agraveyard&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname), and most of them are subtly different to the rest in some way that's going to be *critical* to a question. And look! [mtg:Nighthowler] isn't even in that search, because it's subtly different in yet another way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, even if I replace a card name in a title with a description of that relevant mechanic, usually the question will still be uniquely about just one card. If a new question arrives about a card with similar mechanics, it often _won't_ be a full duplicate of the previous one, even if we might go into detail on the same mechanics again. Generalising the title doesn't necessarily make it a good dupe candidate, in other words.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Generalising is often gainless&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I could ask a question titled ***What about {thing} when I have Etherium Sculptor out?***, or I could title it more generally with ***What about {thing} when I have a creature out that makes artifacts cost 1 less?***, except there's [very few cards like that](http://magiccards.info/query?q=o%3Aartifact+o%3Aspells+o%3Acost+o%3Aless+o%3Acast) and Etherium Sculptor is one of them.

The collectible aspect is clearly not about playing the game and more so about enjoying the card game as simply collectible items, the meta-game. This at first seems off topic to me, but I am not sure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some example questions pertaining the collectible aspect would involve asking about the rarity of certain types of cards, acquirement of cards, asking about value, questions about availability or about the release of new series/sets/types of cards, etc...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is the collectible aspect which does not actually involve playing the game, on topic? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If not, *should it be*? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;IMO, the reason why I think it should, is because the experts and knowledge base of these games are already here and the community is united as fans of the game. Experts of playing trading card games most likely also have excellent knowledge of the collectible aspect. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conversely, a proposal like [this][1] has no common uniting theme aside from all being collectors, and the collectionable items are just too vastly different.

The reasons were several, and mostly correctly guessed by others:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* I don't like deleting comments during the active phase of a Q/A. I personally find it weird and disturbing to come back and find my comments gone. And I take pride in my good comments, and like to occasionally check them out and see if they got voted up. An alternative, also valid point of view is that cleaning up comments keeps the site clean and focussed on the essentials. From a moderation perspective, I take the same position as Pat - I remove old comments that are no longer necessary, but I give them a grace period. Since *I personally* don't see a lot of value in comment removal, I don't put a lot of effort into it, but if I see them, and they're uncontroversial, I remove them.&#xD;&#xA;* When the content of the comments has been fully incorporated into an answer, or an issue has been unambiguously resolved to the satisfaction of all parties, then I tend to delete them immediately.&#xD;&#xA;* Removing comments sometimes upsets the commenter. It then takes more time to explain why the comment was removed, and deal with the upset. So if the situation is relatively neutral, I err on the side of retaining comments.&#xD;&#xA;* Comment flags are prolific, and they aren't all that important in the greater scheme of things. I'm sympathetic to [the discussion here][1]. The main points are 1) there are a lot of comment flags, 2) they take a surprising amount of work to resolve correctly, 3) they aren't a huge value add.&#xD;&#xA;* Sometimes it's not easy to tell whether a comment is truly obsolete. Although I am a Magic player, I don't play with modern cards. It's significant effort to prove the flag, and in my opinion, value judgements like this quickly enter a murky world where moderation can overstep its authority. See for example my discussion of the [not an answer flag][2].&#xD;&#xA;* Accepting/declining is a way of giving feedback to you, the flag raiser. By declining, I am suggesting this flag was not worth raising. In my opinion, although there is nothing technically *wrong* with these flags, they are not worth the time for you to raise, and for me to understand, arbitrate and manage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251175/stack-overflow-is-not-yet-a-vast-wasteland-a-history-of-moderator-tooling/251176#251176&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/167624/can-we-have-an-unambiguous-official-ruling-on-what-the-not-an-answer-flag-is" />

Protecting the question means that if someone wants to post a link to promote their printing service, they have to post a good question or good answer elsewhere first. But blatant spammers tend to have a &quot;quantity over quality&quot; mentality; they want to plaster their links as many places as possible without investing time and effort, since that's how they make a profit. It's not worth their time to come up with another good question or answer, post it, and wait to accumulate 10 rep.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If someone who does have 10 rep on this site posts an answer that seems to be purely promotional, well, perhaps they are just recommending a service that they've found to be useful. Perhaps not. But they do have at least a slight posting history that you can use to help you make that judgement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another thing you can do is (get a moderator to) add the &quot;insufficient explanation&quot; post notice, which says that answerers are expected to include some detail in their answers, not just post a link. It also needs to be enforced through aggressive flagging and deletion of link-only answers. If that happens, it further raises the bar for spammers. I think your spam problem would pretty much disappear at that point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Honestly, though, I wonder whether questions like this, which can be effectively answered with just a link, are really a good idea on SE.

If you read [in the help center about closing questions][2], for example how we decide if they're too broad, it explicitly mentions things about what kinds of answers the question is asking for. This is true all over the place anywhere in the help and on meta.stackexchange.com when people discuss these things. This is a key part of how we judge questions. So no, we can't *prove* it, but we can discuss it and make sane decisions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **We shouldn't discuss this on meta.** Again, completely absurd. If you want to discuss whether question closure is a good topic for meta, start another meta question about it, I guess, but this is what the meta.stackexchange.com FAQ say to do if you think a question has been closed in error (doing it when it's only halfway there is pretty much equivalent) and people have been doing it across the stackexchange network for years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/124489/133299&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/help/closed-questions" />

I think we should not have a [tag:protection] tag, for the reasons you mention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also think we should not have a [tag:magic-protection] tag, or any similar tag that refers to a specific rule of the game. This is for three reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Nobody is an expert in &quot;protection.&quot; Playing Magic and knowing where to look for rules references effectively makes someone an expert in Magic in general, but there's no reason that someone would know just the rules for one specific part of the game without having significant general knowledge of how the game works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2.

That could be more easily accomplished by reading http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/6915/what-does-protection-from-quality-do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. As Jefromi points out, tags may not be added consistently, which can actually worsen search experience. If we have tags for some keyword abilities but not others, and for some ability words but not others, and that choice is made based on site activity, it makes this problem much worse. If a new user asks a question, they would have to attempt to tag it with every ability the question is actually about to properly tag the question. As question volume grows, this could even make it difficult for experienced editors, who would have to know every keyword that has a tag to recognize when a question is missing one. In addition, a question that asks about the interaction between five different keyword abilities (I'm sure it's possible) would be impossible to tag correctly if all those abilities have tags. All of these are parts of the same problem: in the context of search, a tag should allow someone to find all questions about that topic; with these sorts of tags, that may be difficult or even impossible to accomplish.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bmagic-the-gathering%5D%20is%3Aquestion%20protection" />

If I'm quoting a single rule with subrules (101.1, 101.1a, 101.1b), I'll put the rule numbers (bolded) in the quotation for consistency and make the subrules into a bulleted list. If I'm quoting multiple rules at the same level (101.1, 101.2, 101.3), I'll make them into a bulleted list because they are a list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes, when I am quoting a long rule, I want to keep context, so I will quote the entire rule and bold the part relevant to my answer.

However, rule books are primarily definitional. If we look at the Magic: the Gathering rulebook (which I have the experience), the first **five** major headings define the parts of the game. The first one defines the fundamental concepts, and the next four give more detailed definitions for some of those concepts. Because these rules are definitions, they enumerate what relevant actions a player can take, and the player cannot take other actions **by definition**. If someone asks &quot;Can I do X when I have priority?&quot; the response is &quot;Rule 116 defines priority. You can only do the things it lists.&quot; If they ask &quot;Can I choose purple as a color for some effect?&quot; you don't need to scour the rulebook to find a rule that allows it, you just need to quote the definition of color in rule 105.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a couple of issues here.

However, rule books are primarily definitional. If we look at the Magic: the Gathering rulebook (which I have the experience), the first **five** major headings define the parts of the game. The first one defines the fundamental concepts, and the next four give more detailed definitions for some of those concepts. Because these rules are definitions, they enumerate what relevant actions a player can take, and the player cannot take other actions **by definition**. If someone asks &quot;Can I do X when I have priority?&quot; the response is &quot;Rule 116 defines priority. You can only do the things it lists.&quot; If they ask &quot;Can I choose purple as a color for some effect?&quot; you don't need to scour the rulebook to find a rule that allows it, you just need to quote the definition of color in rule 105.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a couple of issues here. First, the fact that your question was downvoted. For that, we have to consider the revision history, since people were voting before you edited to your current version. If we look at the [original version][1] of your answer, you had this &quot;proof by contradiction&quot; that had these assumptions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  1. You have 10 points.&#xD;&#xA; 2. The game has not ended yet.&#xD;&#xA; 3. You win when you have 10 points. &#xD;&#xA;  - This assumption is taken directly from the rules.&#xD;&#xA; 4. The game ends when a player wins. &#xD;&#xA;  - This assumption is taken directly from the rules.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem I see here is that according to the arguments you used, the rules quoted in points 3 and 4 (or even just point 3) are sufficient to conclude that if a player has 10 points, then the game is over. In other words, your argument is logically equivalent to &quot;&quot;According to [rule from point 3] and [rule from point 4], the game ends when any player has 10 points.&quot; Unless I am missing something major, that conclusion is also the conclusion of your answer. Everything besides those two rules is unnecessary to the argument and just makes it more convoluted. The strategy of using &quot;proof by contradiction&quot; was completely unnecessary and made the logic harder to follow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I just want to make this clear: the argument you originally gave was bad because it had an unnecessary step (contradicting a made-up premise) and, for the conclusion you seemed to be &quot;proving&quot;, two or three unnecessary premises.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second issue is the more general one of people asking for rulings that may not exist. The fact that I mostly answer MTG questions probably biases my view of this, but in my experience the rules don't just allow you to do some things or disallow you from doing some things; they specify **exactly** what players can do. The point is that every situation should have a definitive ruling from the rules, and as I said in my previous paragraph, that seems to be the case for this question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a final note about FAQs: rules in games are not like rules in math or science, which must be discovered and/or proven. They are true **because** they are the rules of the game. Any official rulings therefore come from the highest possible authority and are therefore as true as the rules themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/revisions/21119/1" />

The newest question. The newest question is the simplest expression of the question we have so far, and the others add some complexity that distracts from the actual answer.

If we want to implement this, we need 5 votes to open each of the two closed questions, and 5 more votes to close the 2 older questions as duplicates. I think doing it half-way will end up worse than leaving it in the current state. We don't want to have two of the questions open, or all of them closed, or a chain of duplicates. Each of those provides a worse user experience than what we currently have. Basically, we should try to make sure we put the votes together before we start.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Asker experience&#xD;&#xA;When someone asks a question and it gets closed, it often feels like a punishment or reprimand. And in some sense, that's accurate. Closing as &quot;off-topic&quot; or &quot;too opinion based&quot; means that they should have read the FAQ. Closing as a duplicate means that they should have searched before asking. Usually users take the message more harshly than we mean it, but the meaning is generally still there.

As for you proposals:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. I'm not opposed to merging Poker into here, but [they are][2] so until they change their mind it is a rather moot point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. I think this is a bad idea. For one in addition to not wanting to be combined with us Poker doesn't want to be combined with Gambling or Casino Games either, since while their game does regularly take place in a casino it involves more skill than luck and you aren't playing against the house. Also while Poker and some other card games like Blackjack make some sense being combined with Casino Games and Gambling there are plenty other like Dominion and other deck building games, and Magic and other TCG/CCG games that are harder to justify combining. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here we have a clearly definied scope for our questions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Be playable on or around a table &#xD;&#xA; - Have objective rules of play and win&#xD;&#xA;   conditions &#xD;&#xA; - Offer dynamic challenges, either through other players,&#xD;&#xA;   randomization, or both &#xD;&#xA; - Be playable by hand, by human players&#xD;&#xA;   implementing all of the rules&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Poker clearly falls into all of those categories, which is why I'm not opposed to them merging into here, however not all [casino games][3] fall under that criteria, and gambling is not on topic here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As Rainbolt says it seems like you are trying to avoid overlap, and I think having some overlap isn't a bad thing. Poker questions can still be asked here, and they generally get answered (the only on that hasn't was more about probability that poker anyway), if someone comes here with a poker question that is off topic we can always migrate the question to the Poker SE. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Gambling however is a completely separate topic from what we cover here, as such I do not support merging that proposal with us or expanding our scope to include it.

How do you decide what the consensus is? You can visit different communities and they can not only give you different opinion's on which card is better but they can give you different reasons why one card is better then the other. A lot comes done to play style and experience. If one group has figured out a trick to get more use from a card they will likely value it higher then a group that hasn't.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Personal play style and deck construction. This plays a lot into the value of a card. If a card fits into the overall style and construction of your deck you are going to place more value on it then if it doesn't. Which means that if Card A fits into your deck better then card B it doesn't matter that others think more highly of Card B.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Expansions, while I know that answers will get out of date when expansions and rules change the simple fact that a cards value can change drastically with each expansion. Cards can get better as new combos get introduced or get worse as cards leave the legal sets or as rules change.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; " />

Recently he was on his couch thinking, &quot;Blue is the best color, so many cool fliers.  I wonder what the best one is?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This person doesn't have a real problem.  He just wants to talk.  Let's sent him on to a forum.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2 - The serious player.  She's been trying out a new deck for a couple weeks, took it to her local store.  She did OK, but got crushed by certain decks.  She thinks a blue flier might help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This person has a real problem.

You can use my name, it's totally OK!  It sounds like you disagree with my style of moderation.  That's cool too.  I've been pretty consistent over the last four years, but have been known to learn new tricks.  I haven't been as active over the last few months, but I'm here now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What do I do around here?**  Primarily respond to flags and take the action that I think is necessary.  We don't get a ton of flags here compared to other sites, but there are enough to form patterns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What the types of flags I deal with?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. New users generate flags.  Mostly very short answers or substandard questions&#xD;&#xA; 1. Disagreeable comments.  There have been a rash of these lately.  If you saying something that is in the least bit negative about another person, someone will flag it, and I will likely delete it.  Please make your points in a positive way, or not at all.  Most of these seem to start by wanting to improve a question or answer.  That is awesome, but in many cases, people ... keep ... going...  I'm totally on board with the original poster becoming frustrated right around the third &quot;helpful suggestion&quot;.  Soon after that, tempers fray, things are said, flags are raised, nobody looks good.&#xD;&#xA; 1. Too many comments - The system flags any post that gets 20+ comments.  This happens a lot around here.  Take that for what it is and know that a moderator will show up and likely prune *any* long comment thread.  If you need to have a long discussion, feel free to take it to chat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bottom line, when a flag goes off, I'm probably going to annoy someone with the action I take (even if I take none...which happens a bunch too).  If you don't want moderation, avoid the situations mentioned above when possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**What can you do to help?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have high rep, please spend some time in the review queue if you're able.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other than that, if you see a problem, fix it. If you think a question can be improved, edit it instead of commenting. If the poster reverts your change, just walk away, leave a comment if you think the error is egregious.  You do not have to &quot;win&quot; every time you disagree with someone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have an answer to a question, post an answer not a comment. Even if its just part of an answer.  Answers are not likely to be voted down unless they are factually wrong.  Put it out there, that gives other people a dedicated place to comment on your ideas rather than you hijacking the original posters comment thread.  Nobody wants to try to wallow through a long comment thread that is really three different conversations interweaved with each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks for listening!" />

It is the proper forum for questioning moderation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oddly, the question you chose to post contains a quick answer within the text of your question.  I'll give the better answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;@murgatroid99 - SE is not a platform for polls. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You *admitted* you set up a poll in a comment.  You also stated that you probably covered all possible answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The question reads as subjective to me. I thought it had the potential to be good subjective, which is why I did not downvote it or vote to close. Instead, I presented the two answers that I expect this question to get (approximately), with the expectation that votes would indicate consensus about which answer is correct.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Posting multiple answers can be valid, but should be rare. Attempting to cover the whole answer space by posting diametrically opposed answers does not help.  You cannot believe that both answers are true.  I didn't read everything in all threads you linked to but I didn't see any indication of support for answers that the poster does not believe in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The difference between multiple answers and &quot;a poll&quot; is where we might differ.  To me, someone posting different answers is proposing two different answers to a problem.  They believe in each one, but do not know which is best so they offer both to the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would like to see the answerer willing to own both answers, curating them as new information flows in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**This you did not do**.  (From another comment)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I don't have an answer to that. I was trying to present the argument as I understood it. I don't know enough to improve this answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Intent is everything.  I believe your intent was to set up a poll and not provide different yet simultaneously correct answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think your actual thoughts on the question were contained with a comment on the main question.  (Don't put your answers in comments!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Since it's not explicitly mentioned in the tournament rules, it most likely varies from one judge to another. The situations you mention support that hypothesis: some judges say that the would rule it as slow play, while others clearly don't. I'm not really sure what you're expecting here besides one answer with &quot;yes, it is slow play&quot; and explanation, and another with &quot;no, it is not slow play&quot; and explanation. And you already seem to have provided both of those explanations. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that I've received a chance to put my thoughts down on this it seems that I did make a mistake.  You haven't stated clearly what the answer you most believe in is.  You've given three answers (including the comment).  I only deleted two and could lead to confusion or possibly signal which answer I prefer.  I've rectified that.  I encourage you to re-answer that question if you are able to clarify your own thoughts about what the correct answer should be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Why are polls bad? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm sure most are aware of this, but for completeness I wanted to answer this briefly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SE works because it connects people with questions to people with answers.  People are incented to answer in part because of reputation.  At the time I deleted the second answer there were a total of 5 upvotes and 6 downvotes to the two questions.  Prior to the deletion that resulted in +38 reputation.  This leads to a higher rep and the user being slightly more trusted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Repeat this a few dozen times and you begin to see the issue.  How many questions do we get that can be boiled down to &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; ?  How much reputation could be gained just by answering quickly and first regardless of the correctness of the answer?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The race to be first is already strong enough.  The rewards are evident. But lets encourage each person to lead with their best answer and be rewarded thusly. Attempting to monopolize the whole answer space should not be rewarded.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## tl;dr&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believed what I did was in the best interests of the site and/or community.&#xD;&#xA;" />

This culminated in a comprehensive ban. You can read the final decision and discussion thereof [here][1], and [searching the meta site for &quot;recommendation&quot;][2] will let you catch up on the history. See also [Q&amp;A is Hard, Let's Go Shopping][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Some recommendation questions can be shaped into good, allowable questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the comments on the meta discussion linked above, someone asked about the question &quot;What games can I play with my blind son and my seeing son?&quot; As is, this is a recommendation question that we'd rather not have. One of the issues about answers to recommendation questions is that voting is more of a popularity contest than a measure of quality, which would be an issue here. However, reworked as &quot;How can I play games with both my seeing children and blind son?&quot; it becomes a question where more ideas could be shared, often with specific examples to back them up. There's a strong possibility of more helpful, creative answers that could be voted on somewhat objectively. That said, if you're just interested in finding more deck-building games like Dominion, try some of the resources below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Where should I go for game recommendations?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **[The Board and Card Games Chat][4]** is a great place to ask for recommendations, or to just shoot the breeze with other board gamers. Don't be discouraged if no one's there, just leave a message and people will tag you in responses so you get notified.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [**BoardGameGeek**][5] has lists and reviews, lets you search games by categories such as number of players, game mechanic, and appropriate age, and forums where you can ask for all the opinions you want. Most online retailers selling games have reviews and can help you find games similar to others that you like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Your Friendly Local Game Store:** Do a search, you might be surprised at how many there are. Other customers and the staff are great people to talk to about what you like, and they can usually help you find something and even let you try it out before buying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/656/1749&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/search?q=recommendation&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/49/board-and-card-games&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://boardgamegeek.com/" />

This culminated in a comprehensive ban. You can read the final decision and discussion thereof [here][1], and [searching the meta site for &quot;recommendation&quot;][2] will let you catch up on the history. See also [Q&amp;A is Hard, Let's Go Shopping][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Some recommendation questions can be shaped into good, allowable questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the comments on the meta discussion linked above, someone asked about the question &quot;What games can I play with my blind son and my seeing son?&quot; As is, this is a recommendation question that we'd rather not have. One of the issues about answers to recommendation questions is that voting is more of a popularity contest than a measure of quality, which would be an issue here. However, reworked as &quot;How can I play games with both my seeing children and blind son?&quot; it becomes a question where more ideas could be shared, often with specific examples to back them up. There's a strong possibility of more helpful, creative answers that could be voted on somewhat objectively. That said, if you're just interested in finding more deck-building games like Dominion, try some of the resources below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Where should I go for game recommendations?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **[The Board and Card Games Chat][4]** is a great place to ask for recommendations, or to just shoot the breeze with other board gamers. Don't be discouraged if no one's there, just leave a message and people will tag you in responses so you get notified.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [**BoardGameGeek**][5] has lists and reviews, lets you [search games][6] by categories such as number of players, game mechanic, and appropriate age, and forums where you can ask for all the opinions you want.

Example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I see that you've asked for a list of all the Blue cards. Why don't you try asking how you can search for cards with a specific color? We prefer questions that ask for a process rather than a list of cards.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Can we answer with a process rather than a list?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, we only need comments, edits, and a shift in attitude. If you see an answer that only has a list, add a process or suggest that the author do so. And don't upvote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do not start replacing the lists that are already out there. That would be destructive. Lists, when not too large, actually do add value to answers, but I think they should be paired with information about how the list was developed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/22485/6692&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/20474/6692&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/22796/6692&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/24236/6692" />

How combative are your opponents?

Linking to it is an additional helpful thing to do in many cases. For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* a link to a forum thread containing a response from the game designer is pretty much required. It's unique, and might be hard to find otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;* a link to the [Arkham Horror FAQ][1] is good. It's not obvious that it exists if all you have is the game. Similarly, if you're citing the errata from the [Dunwich Horror rules][2], it's good link to them. Readers might only have the base game.&#xD;&#xA;* a link to the [Arkham Horror rules][3] is nice, but optional. I'd generally do it, because it's easy, and it might save someone the time of getting the rules out of the box to see. But if it's missing, it's not a huge deal; the OP does have a copy of the rules with the game, and they have Google to find them online if they want.&#xD;&#xA;* If you only used the rules incidentally, and most of the answer is about something else, don't worry about it.&#xD;&#xA;* If you can't find the rules online at all, don't worry about it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for Magic, I don't think it's really worth it to make any kind of policy. It's similar to the &quot;nice, but optional&quot; case in the list above. True, the rules are *only* available online, but that generally means that people already know how to find them, especially the kind of people actually interested in reading the comprehensive rules.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's incredibly rare that someone asks for a source; most people are happy to either read what's quoted in the answer or use Google to find more. If someone really can't figure it out, they can ask a question. ([That has happened][4], once.) So the potential upside is pretty low, not enough to warrant spending our time editing links into answers or commenting asking everyone to include them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's also a case of diminishing returns. If even 1/10 of the answers to Magic questions have a link to the rules, the odds are pretty low that anyone hasn't seen one yet. The more links there are, the less important it is that we bother adding them to more answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, sure, link if you like. It certainly doesn't hurt. But I definitely don't want to see anyone getting badgered to include links.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Arkham_Horror/FAQs/Complete_Arkham_FAQ.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Arkham_Horror/DH_rules_english.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Arkham_Horror/AH_Rules_internat.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/13259/precise-rules-for-mtg" />

That tells me that our moderators probably handle these types of flags differently. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but in this case I think our moderators need to be consistent. I expect answer-comment flags to be handled in a consistent manner, be it &quot;helpful&quot; or &quot;declined&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You mentioned the Help page.
