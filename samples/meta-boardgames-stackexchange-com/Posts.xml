There is some talk in there about the board-game tag, but it's lost in the noise.  For me, these two tags are clearly duplicate tags: boardgame, board-game and board-games. But there are really two things at issue here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there ever a time a tag should refer to a plural entity?  For me, no.

A question that pertains to the Catan universe could be tagged as &lt;code&gt;Catan&lt;/code&gt;, but I think those will be very rare.  While our current usage basically only mentions the core game and thus one tag, more detailed tags would be better for if we get significant number of questions about the Catan games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I agree that when you first think of Catan, you're probably going to think of the original game, that's not gonig to be the case for everyone.  Settlers of Catan has had three major expansions and other game series like &quot;Starfarers of Catan&quot;, and &quot;Catan Card Game&quot; have been launched featuring the Catan name.  If all the Catan games could be played together, I think one tag to encompass them all would be a viable solution.  Since these are actually distinct games, multiple tags would be more precise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even the base Catan games plays very different then when playing with the Cities &amp;amp; Knights expansion.

At this stage, it's much more useful to get discussion out in the open about whether and why certain questions should be closed, so we can come up with good rules of thumb about certain circumstances, and when people wonder in the future why their questions are being closed, we can link to the discussion demonstrating the community consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The SE close/reopen system is somewhat weak; it only gives a way for people to support keeping a question open after it has been closed, and it leads to back-and-forth close/reopen cycles for debatable questions, since it takes only 5 votes either way to close or reopen it.

Either you have one question for each term you want defined, and thus have them scattered all over and hard to find, or you have one big question for all terms in a particular game. In the latter case, you either do a &quot;one term per answer&quot;, in which voting isn't particularly useful, or you ask for a single complete answer, in which case that one answer is essentially equivalent to a wiki page out of its native habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simply defining terms is best left for a wiki (in the case of the specific question referred to above, Wikipedia seems to have a great article on it), or some sort of glossary of terms for that game, but not well suited to a question and answer site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A question and answer site is for answering questions that aren't adequately answered by an obvious Google search, or referring to a reference work for the topic in question. It's for situations that aren't covered by existing references, or are covered but the information might be hard to find or expressed unclearly. A question and answer site is good for clarifying a concept, or learning how it applies to a particular situation, not simply defining it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit to add&lt;/strong&gt; This doesn't mean that I think we should close every easily Googlable question.

I suspect that will rise a bit as we close off-topic or bad questions, and as we go into the public beta and can widen our userbase a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the acceptance rate does seem to be a bit low, too. I've answered a bunch of questions, and none of those questions have had any answers accepted. Likewise, I've asked a few questions, and haven't accepted any answers on them. In some cases, we might need to just gently remind people to accept answers; on SO, I will frequently remind users that they should probably accept an answer that they found useful (I frequently see people post a comment saying &quot;that's it, thanks!&quot; without checking the checkmark). So, on questions that are clearly asking for a single answer, and in which there is at least one reasonable looking, upvoted answer, we should probably encourage users to accept those answers. Users will probably be reminded a bit more once we've had enough time for people's personal acceptance rates to start showing up; then people will see that they have acceptance rates of 0% or 10%, and be motivated to accept more answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One issue is that many questions on this SE are asking not for a single answer, but a list of answers. I've addressed these types of questions in &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/132/games-for-some-kind-of-player-games-with-some-kind-of-property-questioins&quot;&gt;another thread on meta&lt;/a&gt;; so far, it seems that people think these kinds of questions are OK, but not many people have chimed in yet. This type of question can't ever really have a single accepted answer; if there are 10 or 20 games which meet the criteria, then there's no reason to accept one over the other, unless you happen to have a very specific situation in mind (the very next game you buy, or the very next game you play with your niece).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A possible solution would be to make these sorts of questions community wiki, as I don't think community wiki questions are expected to necessarily have an accepted answer; but that's recently been disabled, except for moderators, and we don't have moderators yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr Go out and encourage people to accept more answers, and we need to figure out what to do with all of the questions for which a whole list of answers are a good response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a template for prodding people:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You might want to accept an answer for this question, if there's an answer that meets your needs. If not, I'd recommend asking for clarification in comments, or editing your question to be more specific, so people can edit their answers or write new ones that will better answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit to add&lt;/strong&gt; Oh! And another possible reason we're seeing this problem here is that for game recommendation questions, you can't just test out an answer to see if it works for you, as you can for a programming question on StackOverflow. Most of the time, to see if a game is good, you need to actually find some other players, or wait for your regular game night, convince them to play it, and then do so. It might be pretty hard to figure out in a timely manner if a game recommendation works for you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect, though, that many of the current recommendation threads are not because people are actually looking for a game to play in a particular situation that is likely to come up soon, but are intended as &quot;example&quot; questions to help start the community going, for which it's even harder to actually test and decide on which answer is best for the person asking the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="112" LastEditorUserId="112" LastEditDate="2010-10-22T03:59:18.203" LastActivityDate="2010-10-22T03:59:18.203" CommentCount="1" />

I am aware that the ♦ next to your name will make people take what you say and do more seriously, and so I would be very careful to be even-handed, and not take action unless there is a clear community consensus, or there is an emergency and no consensus immediately apparent. For instance, I would be very reluctant to unilaterally close a question, unless it was very clearly inappropriate and needed immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, part of the job of a moderator is to help lead the community. In cases in which consensus is not readily apparent, the moderator can be a tie-breaking voice, speaking with more authority.

If someone is interested in Settlers of Catan, they might follow the settlers-of-catan tag. If, however, they have never played the Cities and Knights expansion, they might not want to bother reading questions involving it, and so set the cities-and-knights tag to ignored. That way, they can quickly scan the questions, paying particular attention to the the Settlers questions but being able to see that they can skip the ones about the Cities and Knights expansion explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tags can also be helpful when someone wants to look for questions on a particular topic; they can browse questions tagged with that. If you just put the expansion in the title, and don't tag it, then it won't show up in that list when people are looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I'd say that if the question is about the expansion, and can only be answered with knowledge of the expansion or is only of interest to someone who wants to know about the expansion, then tag it as such.

For instance, the rule you mention, can it be played on a table, is a good one, but not sufficient, as you can sit down and play an RPG on a table, but I think that's off topic for this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few areas where we need to figure out exactly where to draw the line. To the left are what I would consider solidly on topic, to the right probably off topic, and we need to figure out where the line is in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Coop games - Solitaire games - puzzles&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Diplomatic games - creativity games - roleplaying games&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dexterity games - lawn games - sports&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Board games with random or rule-based extra players - computer implementations of board games - board games with electronic components - computer games&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first category, I think that solitaire games are on topic, while puzzles (such as Sudoku or crosswords) are off topic. But how to distinguish solitaire games from puzzles? I believe the criterion would be that solitaire games essentially produce an endless or large variety of different puzzles through randomization (most solitaire card games involve just shuffling a deck of cards, solitaire or coop games might involve rolling dice or other forms of randomization), while puzzles are static and new puzzles in a particular category (such as Sudoku or crosswords) must be created by another person or computer. I would, however, say that questions about puzzles that are specifically related to a board or card game, and commonly used in training for playing board and card games, would be OK; for instance, &quot;I'm working on this chess problem, and the book lists this solution, but I just can't figure out why this other line of play doesn't work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the second category, I think the distinguishing criterion is that there are objective rules and win conditions in a board game. The win condition or outcome of a situation might be based on subjective votes or other actions from other players, but once people have made their decisions, there is a set of rules for determining the winner or outcome of a situation. In a roleplaying game, a GM is needed for deciding which rules to apply, running NPCs, etc, and so there is no objective set of rules for resolving situations or the outcome of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the third category, I believe that dexterity games can be on topic (such as Jenga or Pitch Car), but I think that the rule you mention, that you can fit them on a table, is a good one. Thus, crokinole would be OK, but foosball or pool would not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last category, I think that the rule that you can play it by hand, with no computer involved, should apply. You may use electronic equipment to aid you (an electronic dice roller in place of physical dice, or using a spreadsheet to keep score instead of doing it by hand), and questions about how to do so may be on topic, as long as it's all stuff that you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do by hand. You can't play a game of Quake by hand, so questions about Quake are off topic; but you can play Ticket to Ride by hand, so asking about places to play ticket to ride online are OK.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or to use Pat's example, Civilization and Advanced Civ are clearly on topic, Sid Meier's Civilization is not, as it can't be implemented as a boardgame. The computer game port of Advanced Civ would be on topic, as it's a game that could be played on a board, though for technical questions about it there may be better forums (or may not; people on a boardgame question and answer site may have more familiarity with the online forms of the games than people on a computer game or computer software question and answer site, and a good measure of whether something on topic is whether this is the best place to find people who can answer a question about it), and Sid Meier's Civilization: The Boardgame is on topic, as it's obviously playable by hand on a board instead of on the computer (and if anyone ever implements Civilization: The Boardgame: The Computer Game, asking about that would be on topic too, as it's still playable on a board).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do those seem like a reasonable set of guidelines? In summary, for a &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; to be on topic, it must:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be playable on or around a table&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have objective rules of play and win conditions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Offer dynamic challenges, either through other players, randomization, or both&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be playable by hand, by human players implementing all of the rules&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; to be on topic, it must relate to a game that is on topic, but the particular instance that the question is referring to may loosen those rules. Questions about playing games with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Giant_pieces&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;giant pieces&lt;/a&gt; will make a game not playable around a table, but if it's a game that &lt;em&gt;could be&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;is normally&lt;/em&gt; played around a table, it's fine. Questions about Go problems or Chess problems are fine, even if they are static puzzles, since they are related to a dynamic game. Questions about computer implementations of board games are fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that gives us a pretty good definition of what's on and off topic; there will always be some grey zone, but it will solve most of the problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="112" LastActivityDate="2010-10-25T20:34:07.540" CommentCount="10" />

Don't get me wrong - virtue IS it's own reward but when you are given the choice between receiving recognition for your help or not: what do you prefer? The entire SE/SO system is so focused on rep. Everything depends on how much rep you have.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Anyone can answer a question but you need 100 rep to contribute to CW so you are actually shutting members out that probably would like to help.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what am I saying about CW?

Even if you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; explain to a new (or even an average) user the merits of foregoing ownership in lieu of allowing a broader range of editing, the rules and almost-metaphysical philosophy applied to the feature simply aren't worth the complexity, problems, and abuse it causes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So from @Jeff's post on Meta.SO: &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/392/should-the-community-wiki-police-be-shut-down/7183#7183&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Important change&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;End users can not mark questions wiki anymore, so the only appropriate way to get action on a question you believe really should be wiki, is to flag it for moderator attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple points..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vote-to-wiki will not be implemented&lt;/strong&gt;.

There is also some overlap between social games (or party or parlour games), and board games, so it would be hard to draw an exact dividing line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm less sure about pervasive games; I'm not terribly familiar with them, so if you could write or link to a good definition of them, that would help. What I'm writing here is based on a very rough idea of what they are from a little bit of Googling and glancing at some information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that some of them might be on topic, while some are closer to sports, RPGs, or computer games, which are off-topic. Essentially, I would say for pervasive games, if social interaction, strategic skill, and random chance (dice, cards, RPS) are the bulk of the game, they could probably be considered on-topic, like Werewolf or the social aspects of Diplomacy (which also has a board, so that helps). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there's a significant physical aspect or geographic aspect (as in some Assasin's games or geocaching), it may be off topic; better for a dedicated pervasive games forum, or possibly considered a sport. If there's a substantial roleplaying aspect, or LARP like aspects, it might be more appropriate for a roleplaying forum. If there's a considerable online aspect like Alternate Reality Games, a computer gaming forum could be more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that we should generally try to be inclusive if possible here; try not to close anything as off topic if it could be considered on topic. However, there's a certain aspect of &quot;I'll know it when I see it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can also try and apply the rules of thumb that I listed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/174/if-you-cant-sit-down-at-a-table-and-play-it-its-not-a-board-or-card-game-goo/180#180&quot;&gt;another answer&lt;/a&gt; about what's on topic; &quot;playable on or around a table&quot; may have to be stretched a little, but Diplomacy already stretches that (as you need to be able to go off and make and discuss alliances in secret, so a substantial portion of the game is not around the table). I think a guideline for what is acceptable is that only social interactions may be taking place elsewhere than on or around a table; if there are substantial physical components beyond that, you're rapidly approaching something different than what we cover here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For reference, the rules of thumb I listed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Be playable on or around a table&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Have objective rules of play and win conditions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Offer dynamic challenges, either through other players, randomization, or both&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Be playable by hand, by human players implementing all of the rules&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="112" LastEditorUserId="112" LastEditDate="2010-10-30T22:14:31.863" LastActivityDate="2010-10-30T22:14:31.863" CommentCount="1" />

It has several advantages over other forums or Q&amp;amp;A systems. Unlike forums, you don't have to wade through pages of responses to find the actual answer to a question; answers voted up will move to the top, and the questioner can accept an answer which will become the top one. Unlike other generic Q&amp;amp;A sites, StackExchange sites have specific communities devoted to the topic in question, not just a lot of people answering questions on everything. And unlike most sites of the sort, it also involves wiki-style community editing, in which users with enough reputation can edit questions and answers to provide clarification, fix small errors, or clean up formatting or tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;BoardGameGeek is a great resource, and the Board and Card Games StackExchange is complementary to it, I think.

The first is one that can hopefully be improved as this community grows; likewise, the issue you mention about designers already being on BGG could be addressed by getting designers to answer questions here as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The integration issue might be able to be addressed here; some other sites have added JavaScript to make domain-specific features work (such as rendering TeX on the math oriented sites, or a shortcut for &lt;a href=&quot;http://draw3cards.com/questions/234/how-do-i-enter-card-images-in-questions-and-answers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;adding card images on a Magic: The Gathering SE 1.0 site&lt;/a&gt;); it might be possible for us to do the same here, adding a feature that could easily embed BGG game links and/or images.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that still leave the fact that in the meantime, as we grow our community, we need to be able to say what differentiates us. I think there are few things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The biggest benefit is the actual StackExchange system with questions, answers, voting, and editing. On BoardGameGeek, if you want to ask a rules or strategy question, you have to do it in a forum format. This means that you ask a question, and then there may be several replies of varying quality that are hard to sort through. In some cases, you may get several pages of replies, at which point finding anything is quite hard, and the SEO will be totally broken because the question and answer will be on different pages. On StackExchange, the best replies will be voted to the top; the one that actually answers the question will be at the top and prominently marked. Small errors, or typographical or formatting issues, can be fixed by anyone with enough rep to edit other people's answers (or left as a comment that will be displayed immediately below the question or answer), instead of having to keep reading through the thread to find the one bit of errata that someone else posted.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The simplicity and focus of the site. BoardGameGeek is very complex and busy, with lots of stuff going on. It can be hard to figure out how to ask a question, or where to look (a few of my more poplar answers here have simply been instructions for how to use BoardGameGeek effectively). StackExchange, in contrast, is relatively simple and focused on question and answers. I've pointed out BoardGameGeek to people and heard &quot;ow, I can't even figure out where to start looking.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better SEO. This is related to the above; the simplicity and focus on SE sites, as well as the emphasis on quality content through voting, helps it achieve better Google rankings. There have been questions that are answered on BoardGameGeek, but a simple search didn't answer it; I had to try adding &quot;site:boardgamegeek.com&quot; to my search in order to find the answer, and filter through a lot of irrelevant results.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Creative Commons license on all of the content is another reason that I prefer to use SE to BGG. I used to contribute fairly heavily to BGG, but BGG and the authors of any content retain sole rights to any of the content posted there. Thus, BGG is allowed to use and profit off of my content as they see fit, while I'm not allowed to use the database or anyone else's content for any other purposes. This makes it hard to, say, create a read-only fork of BGG with a better interface, which could be quite useful and by competing with BGG inspire them to clean their interface up a bit. BGG is a collaboratively edited resource, but pretty much wholly owned by a few individuals, while all of the content in SE is available for anyone to use as they see fit (within the bounds of the license).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I disagree with your point about the focus being broader here than at BGG. I think that what's on topic at each is pretty much equivalent. BGG has Risk, Monopoly, and Trivial Pursuit pages, with forums that people discuss them, which can show up on your front page. There may be a slightly different proportion of questions on certain games here vs at BGG, but that's going to be the case anywhere; I don't think that in the long run, there will be much more discussion of Trivial Pursuit here than on BGG, especially if we succeed in getting more serious gamers involved here. And if there are games you're particularly interested in or don't want to hear about, add them to your &quot;interesting tags&quot; or &quot;ignored tags&quot; lists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="112" LastEditorUserId="112" LastEditDate="2010-11-02T20:36:59.167" LastActivityDate="2010-11-02T20:36:59.167" CommentCount="3" />

I think emotionally we &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the cube is a puzzle.  But it's hard for me to deny that 'produce a cube with solid-coloured faces' is a victory condition for a one-player game, and there are a clear set of legal moves to use to achieve it.  (That there is a known algorithm for achieving it is clearly not an obstacle; there's a known solution to Connect 4 as well but it's clearly a game.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pace gomad's answer, I think single-player games and puzzles usually both possess a defined winning condition (a goal), and a legal sequence of moves to attempt to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;: A single-player activity with a goal and legal moves is a &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to a puzzle, if it also possesses a clear &lt;strong&gt;losing condition&lt;/strong&gt;; that is, a game-state under which the goal can no longer be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This rules out Rubik's cube, crosswords, and other puzzles where you can always keep trying.  It allows Freecell and other solitaire card games (they usually have a can't-try-any-more-moves end-state).

  <row Id="281" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2010-11-23T16:37:30.563" Score="14" ViewCount="140" Body="&lt;p&gt;I have recently seen several examples of highly subjective questions which were made community wiki by a moderator, presumably in order to give them some semblance of propriety. The most current example is &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/1456/who-is-your-favourite-game-designer&quot;&gt;Who is your favourite game designer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, to some extent I sympathise with the problem the moderators face. You don't necessarily want to just close these questions without any community support, lest you face the accusation that you are being too heavy-handed or authoritarian. You may expect the community to eventually deal with the question. However, in the interim, the question continues, people get points, and it seems unfair. Or maybe you just have a more liberal outlook on subjective questions, and feel that more site content is basically a positive thing. So, CW, and where's the harm?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this situation, it may seem reasonable to convert the question to community wiki. No one gets any rep any more, the close votes can continue to accrue, and if the community feels strongly enough, it will eventually be shut. Also, on Stack Overflow, there is a history of users pressuring others to convert subjective questions to CW, normally with the threat of close votes if they do not comply (the so-called 'Wiki police'). This is a norm that many users feel they understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are four problems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjective questions are not inherently evil. But they are much harder to write well. Most of them are poor questions, and should not exist. This is described in detail in the blog post &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot;&gt;Good Subjective, Bad Subjective&lt;/a&gt;. This is official Stack Exchange policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Converting a post to CW requires moderator intervention. It therefore sends out a strong signal. It says &quot;I am a moderator on this site, and I think this question is ok, because I haven't stopped it, and in fact I am encouraging it to exist.&quot; This is harmful. Most users are not very experienced with the Stack Exchange engine, and they are looking for guidance about community norms. This sends the message &quot;lousy questions are fine, as long as a mod can stop by and fix them up with CW.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community Wiki was recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/392/should-the-community-wiki-police-be-shut-down/7183#7183&quot;&gt;banished for all normal users&lt;/a&gt;. Why was this done? Why can only moderators set the CW flag? It happened to avoid exactly this situation - weak questions being protected from closure by the nullifying of reputation gains. CW was originally intended &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for the situation where you have an answer, and would like to explicitly dilute your ownership, and encourage the community to improve it. It is a signal that says 'this content is jointly owned - please improve it'. The reputation feature is just a side-effect. Preventing reputation increases is &lt;em&gt;not the purpose&lt;/em&gt; of community wiki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no longer reasonable (if it ever was) to pressure users into making questions community wiki. This is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/392/should-the-community-wiki-police-be-shut-down&quot;&gt;official policy&lt;/a&gt;. The line is now much sharper; for almost all questions, they either should exist, or they should be closed. There is no CW limbo space. And it's not sufficient that a user request their question be wikified either; the reason for the CW needs to be clear and &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please can we stop hitting poor questions with the community wiki flag without careful thought?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2014-04-23T13:46:50.313" LastActivityDate="2010-11-24T17:23:39.590" Title="On the over-enthusiastic use of community wiki to protect poor questions" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-wiki&gt;&lt;subjective&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="14" />

Sure, some people's answers were just &quot;I like designer X because he designed game Y&quot;.  But the question itself asked for more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great subjective questions tend to have long, not short, answers&lt;/strong&gt;: Again, I specifically asked to see the reasoning behind people's picks for the top designers working in the field today.  It would have been nice to get more of that, but what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great subjective questions have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone&lt;/strong&gt;: If you can find &quot;ranting and flamebait&quot; in either the way the question was asked, or any of the answers that were provided, then colour me amazed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great subjective questions invite sharing experiences over opinions&lt;/strong&gt;: Once more.  The question asked people to say what qualities and strength they'd discovered over all the games in a designer's career that made that designer a favourite.  If people didn't provide such, then they weren't answering the question as posed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references&lt;/strong&gt;: As above.  How can you nominate someone's design work as great without reference to the unique mechanics and flair they've added to the mix?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great subjective questions are more than just mindless social fun&lt;/strong&gt;: Was this really a &quot;so, what did you have for breakfast this morning?????&quot; type question?

The aforementioned &quot;I like designer X because I like game Y&quot;.  I do however resent the allegation that &quot;the question obviously fails all the criteria in Good Subjective, Bad Subjective&quot;.  It wasn't a lazy, thoughtless question designed to snag a hundred replies and some free reputation - or at least, that very much wasn't the intention!  Yes, I'm new here, perhaps the question wasn't phrased as well as it might have been, and maybe on balance it's better off closed.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I'm finding these sites rather frustrating due to the lack of obvious rhyme or reason as to whether a question is allowed or not.  Currently popular and highly rated question on the boardgames site: what game would you recommend to someone who wanted to play Monopoly with you?  HOW is that any more subjective than &quot;what game would you recommend to someone who is looking for a game by a truly great designer (please show your workings)&quot;?  Don't get me wrong, I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the Monopoly question, I'm just finding people's idea of &quot;excessively subjective&quot; questions, um, excessively subjective!  And I don't really understand why a few loud voices huffing and puffing about how awful a question is trumps at least as many people enjoying, upvoting, following and politely and (reasonably) intelligently debating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="436" LastActivityDate="2010-11-24T00:05:32.953" CommentCount="5" />

However, that is my personal preference and I don't know if I would want to make that a rule. I think every member of the community has the right to answer any question, even questions they asked. In general, it may not be advisable to do so right away in that it may discourage others from answering and may result in the question and answer not being upvoted much, but that's at the discretion of the questioner, IMO. However, I think that mostly goes for objective questions. I'm not sure it's as much an issue for subjective ones. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, is answering one's own question right away discouraged?

There are more to board games than rules!!!!&lt;/strong&gt; :D :D&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put it this way. People come to Stackoverflow because they want to get answers to objective programming questions. Programming is a huge profession that you can make a living with, and many people do. People go there to learn from others and solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This site is about games. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the vast majority of people play games and go to board gaming sites for fun. If what you want from a programming site is strict restrictions to objective only questions, that's fine, and this site could fill that role perfectly. However, IMHO some people want to have fun and ask questions about recommendations and other subjective topics that SO would deem less than perfect. If this site feels like turning them away, we will only be left with questions about rules and strategies. If that's all this site wants to be, that's fine. However, I believe very few people have a reason to specifically talk about strategy and rules and NOT anything subjective/fun, so this site would be left with a very small user-base. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closing fun questions just makes the site unnecessarily strict. They are closed on SO because they are not very useful as programming is about skillfully communicating with computers. Board Games are about fun, and restricting well written, on-topic, useful fun questions is only going to hurt us when the whole site revolves around a source of fun anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I think we need to do is make the site a little more friendly. I doubt most of you had the first 3 questions asked on a stackexchange site closed with almost no explanation. I did, and it doesn't feel good. If this stupid site doesn't want my questions, I'll leave. And I almost did. Fortunately, I stayed and came to love it.

Almost 10% of the questions have been closed, leaving us with &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; 500 after 108 days. &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5220/board-and-card-games&quot;&gt;This isn't good.&lt;/a&gt; The matter at and is that Board &amp;amp; Card games are inherently subjective enough to show that a SE exchange site might not be the right place for them, and users would mostly be better off sacrificing a better UI and site design for &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgamegeek.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a place that actually lets them ask the questions they want&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Am I preaching the doom of this site and saying its terrible?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;NO!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of the problems I listed above hurt me dearly every time I think about them, and I want to make sure we're doing what we can to solve them. We need to put some hustle in so we can be even better if we want to come out of beta. Currently the biggest problem I see is lack of questions, and since most of them never get a fair chance and are closed by 1 mod instead of some of the 50 people who have the privilege cast close votes, this could easily be solved. If they still get closed, the community will have spoken and made the best choice for the site. A mod can never know if they're doing their job right unless they talk to the community, and their actions should always reflect this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I thought this site couldn't make it, I wouldn't spend my time on the meta trying to improve it. I want this site to be able to compete so it gets the chance it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyone else have some suggestions to help us become a real boy? Should we continue the current strict laws on questions and hope we get enough, or should we try loosening things up for a few days to see if that improves things? You'll never know until you try. :D &lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I've been convinced that this site should only allow non-subjective questions in 5h3 interest of preserving high quality Q&amp;amp;A. If it can continue that way, it is probably better than any alternative. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more important part of this question was about how we can help this site succeed. Obviously we can do so by continuing to participate by asking and answering questions, but I'm wondering what else there is we can do. However, if you think my fears that this site will not make it out of beta are unjustified, I will gladly allay them and happily continue to participate with a new spring in my step knowing we will join the proud ranks of the launched sites. :D&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="191" LastEditorUserId="191" LastEditDate="2011-02-06T02:56:40.427" LastActivityDate="2011-08-05T15:09:58.160" Title="How can I help this site make it out of beta?"

The result was almost &lt;strong&gt;3,000 sites shut down with a 99.6% failure rate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's not repeat that mistake. You can't simply lower the quality to attract more questions, thinking that you can somehow just raise the bar later, once the traffic is humming along. It doesn't work that way.

What you are allowed to discuss is very limited.

That will be your only interaction with the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Board Game Geek is different because its just....fun. You can do everything that's offered on this site, like talk about rules and strategy, but you can also just relax with your fellow gamers. You can rate games, talk about your sessions, ask the advice of tons of other gamers about what games you might like, and rate games as to how much you've enjoyed them to help others when they're looking to try something new. Heck you can even get into some polite arguments about what games are better than others; it's all in the interest of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may call all the other stuff 'noise' that gets in the way of the 'true objective questions'. But I don't think anyone else does. You can get whatever experience out of the site that you want. Its just a one-stop-shop for everything you could want to talk about regarding board games, and I still don't see what's to keep people coming here for the tiny topics the sites do overlap in. Yes this site is not at all designed to be like that or have any of those features and they would alter the site greatly if it did, but I don't think we're going to convince people &quot;ask your rule and strategy questions here!

The ultimate goal is to have a good question with a definitive answer.  And some of these questions do have definitive answers. What would be the worst case is for a &quot;Game Like&quot; question to be down-voted or deleted without the merits of the question being considered at all, just because it contains a known pattern.

Most mechanics can be analyzed and compared objectively with other games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the list of correct answers is too long, then the question should be written to be more specific or broken into multiple questions.  The correct answer may even be that the list is too long with a reason of why.  This would give gamers new to a game some insight as to a game's classification or a specific mechanics popularity among games in general.  &quot;Here are a few popular ones, but there are too many to list.&quot; can be a very useful answer in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the question asks for an answer that can differ between people, it may still be a good question, and the correct answer may be a list of things that should be considered.  Questions like game length could fit this category.  Game length can be analyzed and calculated for different groups.  It may have a large deviation, but it is still a number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the question mentions only a game, but doesn't focus on a mechanic, then it should probably go.

Fun can't really be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the question is asking for a recommendation of a new game to players of a different game, it should be removed because that is subjective.  (Only Netflix can answer that. ;) )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the best outcome here is to make these well written questions. The answers may be difficult to find and there may need to be a fair amount of discussion before a correct answer is found, but as long as an answer bubbles up at the end, it was a good question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These questions are also moving targets, as new games are developed.

Voting to close a question brings up a dialog box prompting you to select one of five reasons why the question should be closed. If it doesn't meet one of those reasons, then closure probably isn't the right answer. The whole point is that the closed question is put in time out until the problem is resolved, at which point it can be re-opened--or deleted if no one cares enough to fix the problem. I've seen questions get closed, fixed, and re-opened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;strong&gt;down voting&lt;/strong&gt;, it really has a different purpose. Closure indicates a structural flaw in the question: it's an exact duplicate, it doesn't have an answer, it belongs on another SE site, etc. Down voting serves to suppress a question that doesn't meet the criteria for closure (i.e. there's nothing structurally wrong with it), but just isn't well asked. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jeff points out a good criteria as he explains why the down vote hint has changed: a good question is not only useful but reflects a little bit of work on the part of the questioner. Now this isn't a coding site, so the idea of research is likely to be a little different, but I always cringe when I see someone ask a question that is answered by quoting a crystal clear sentence from the rules. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take a strawman question like &quot;How many dice do you roll in Monopoly to figure out how many spaces to move?&quot; It's a board game question, so on topic; it's objective, a real question, not a duplicate, and not too localized.

But many will have SIMILAR problems. In one case, a partner failed to take out a double when (probably) she should have, because she didn't fully understand the rules. Many players have had that experience with their partners. So let's clarify the rules and apply them to this situation. (And others.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the other case, a partner made a &quot;technically&quot; correct takeout double that failed because of a special feature (her strength in the opponent's suit). If I'm forced to bid over a takeout double, I expect &quot;shape&quot; and maximum support for the unbid suits. Basically, I felt that she violated the &quot;unwritten rules&quot; with only 9 HCP and only 10 cards OUTSIDE the opponents' suit. There are any number of other situations where the &quot;book&quot; says to make a certain bid, and common sense tells you that it's all wrong.

I'm also convinced that we have a &quot;pretty good&quot; closing mechanism, whereby five users can close a question. This mechanism is likely to get better as more people get the 500+ reputation needed to vote to close or reopen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To fill these gaps, and to move the process along, we also have moderators. That's a good thing. I'm all for giving moderators &quot;supervoting&quot; privileges, under my proposal, three ordinary votes. But I'm not willing to give one five, because I don't think one person, even a moderator, should have UNILATERAL closing privileges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I see it, there could be two ways to close a question. The first is when TWO members of the community vote to close. Then a mod comes along and completes the closure with a triple vote instead of waiting for three more from the community. End of story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second type of closure could be initiated by a moderator, followed by two additional votes from the community. It would highlighted as a &quot;proposal to close&quot; and would state the moderator's reasons. The proposal would remain open for up to 48 hours to attract two more close votes from the community, or conversely, vote to re-open. This would also give the questioner a &quot;notice,&quot; plus an opportunity to fix the question. At the end of 48 hours, it would be re-evaluated as discussed in the closing paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a community member, I would likely suppport a moderator his merits. In this example for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/4061/what-is-a-good-place-to-buy-board-games-in-new-york&quot;&gt;What is a good place to buy board games in New York?&lt;/a&gt; I didn't exactly vote to close, but did raise a question about its merits (since I'm relatively new to the site).  I would certainly have contributed one of two votes toward a moderator initiative to close this question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what would happen after 48 hours? At that time, the close-reopen votes be tallied. To tip the balance, a SECOND moderator could close the question with three additional votes (six in total), unless there were two or more &quot;reopen&quot; votes from the community (which would reduce the tally to minus 4). I understand that there are two types of moderators, those drawn from the community, and those drawn from the site itself.

Those can be discussed without playtesting by the asker as long as it ties back into the problem.  However, the question should insist that any answer be based on actual use of the house rule.  Example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'm considering using this house rule. Can anyone that has tried it tell me whether it solves the problems I see with this game?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Question types to avoid&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Asking for recommendations of house rules to solve a problem&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead this question should be phrased to ask if the problem exists.

If Gary Kasparov can't beat Big Blue, you can't either. But there are some computers that YOU can beat. Which ones are they?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way of asking the question is, my strength is X.

My strength is something like 1500, give or take. In order to find &quot;good&quot; opponents, I'd be looking for someone whose strength is in the 1400-1600 range.

It's not really the fault of the OP, who by his own admission is inexperienced, but the question is naive and the answers are not likely to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It really doesn't make a lot of sense to me to talk about how to beat a chess computer. To try and identify a particular 'style' associated with chess A.I. in general, or with a specific chess engine, and then to work against that style, may be possible. It's just not a very good idea. There are only two ways to go with the question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Talk about classic A.I. weaknesses.&lt;/strong&gt; You could say something about how a weak A.I. tends to be poor at sacrifices and combinations, or rook endings, or obscure openings not in its opening book, and waffle a bit about search depth. Whether or not that applies to a modern A.I. on your Mac is probably going to be pure speculation. Whether you can usefully exploit it is speculation again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Talk about general chess improvement.&lt;/strong&gt; Practically, this is the better answer, since your time would be much better spent improving at chess, than at improving against some peculiar A.I play style. However, clearly, such an answer has nothing to do with A.I. It's also a huge, far too broad topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some A.I. programs allow you to 'dumb down' their playing ability, so that you can have a more balanced game. That seems like the obvious fix, if winning is actually the goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A more general point is that improving at chess requires being regularly beaten by good play, so that one can learn and raise one's game. In that sense, the feeling of frustration and striving is rather like learning a musical instrument. If a player doesn't find anything intrinsically enjoyable about that, then chess probably won't be a particularly fulfilling game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastActivityDate="2011-09-12T17:48:10.897" CommentCount="1" />

I can't directly compare as I don't have access to statistics for either site (other than # of questions), but judging it and B&amp;amp;CG's active questions page, D3C's activity looks about equal (or perhaps even greater) to the entirety of B&amp;amp;CG.SE's activity. So it looks there is in fact a market for Magic Q&amp;amp;A, but all of the users are over on some SE 1.0 site! Boo!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, can we convince them to move over to B&amp;amp;CG.SE?

One is the concept of how voting is interpreted across the site, the other on how answers serve as solutions. I think that these questions should be able to work, but the approach may need some extra thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;On voting&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We're talking about the actual vote scores, not the resultant reputation (which is irrelevant to this point). Voting activity is something that is rated on a &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt; scale, not on a &lt;em&gt;per question&lt;/em&gt; scale, and whether or not this works in that understanding. By consequence, and by design, certainly votes are comparable within the scale of a single question. This lets you compare what is a favorable answer to the specific question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the site as a whole uses votes to identify the top performance. A +20 answer on one question should be of similar quality and utility as a +20 answer on a completely different question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's why it's important that the voting scale be universal across the site. The problem I foresee with this &quot;one card per answer&quot; setup is that the voting schema may not line up with the rest of the site. It depends a bit on how the expertise in understanding the strategy will correlate with how people get the answers and how much detail. Certainly, a greater answer will not simply list just the card, but will go into great detail on why it's a great fit. If voting focuses on that detail, then this problem is taken care of. Should this be lost sight of, though, then it will not bode well for the quality of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;On answers&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has been the subject of many blog posts, but to put it simply - the Q&amp;amp;A model thrives on the essence that &lt;em&gt;an individual answer attempts to serve as a conclusion to the question&lt;/em&gt;. That's why acceptance exists and only points out a single answer. When the &quot;solution&quot; to a question is not in a single answer, but is the set of all answers, it becomes difficult for a reader to grasp what the whole picture is. Our format lends itself towards a complete solution within one package (one post), the lack of discrete post organization makes it complex to simply put together combinations of answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of it like asking the question &quot;How do I bake a cake?&quot;, and your separate answers were &quot;You need eggs&quot;, &quot;You need flour&quot;, and similar. It's all part of a whole, and undesirable. The proper answer would be the whole process, not just a single step. That's why we encourage that answers are solutions - so that people get the big picture in one post, not across multiple posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions where there are multiple &quot;items&quot; among the answers, the ones that work are those where a single item &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the answer. If there are multiple strategies to solve a certain problem, then any single one of those strategies can be its own answer because, on their own, they do solve the question at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How this affects these questions depends - is the goal to accumulate strategy among the various cards presented individually? Or is it to find a singular card that works? If it is the former, then it conflicts with how the engine as a norm functions. It may be better not to restrict users to a single card if this is the case - rather, the user could focus on a strategy as a whole (using both specific card make-up as well as general card roles). This also ties in a bit with the previous point, as it will inspire more focus on the detail and the strategy, thus less likely to suffer problems in voting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I should note that sometimes, a strategy really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; boil down to just one card, that it is the unique synergy of that one specific card that works perfectly with the given plan. That's fine if your answer only needs that one card. This point is more to address the scenarios where multiple cards all work towards the same general strategic plan - dividing that into multiple answers is ultimately a disservice to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1639" LastEditorUserId="1639" LastEditDate="2011-09-20T18:17:58.567" LastActivityDate="2011-09-20T18:17:58.567" CommentCount="4" />

Are there questions appropriate for one thing, that are not appropriate for the other?

This gets into issues like the degree of subjectivity allowed.  I can foresee many questions about strategy and deck-building that may fall too far into subjectivity for the BCG site (which tried to have 'correct' answers).  Contrast this with Dominion, which, while it has many cards, has much more straightforward answers because the number of different cards is nowhere close to MTG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone has a high reputation answers questions about Magic, should that mean that person is trusted to answer questions about Chess, and visa-versa?   This goes to the degree of overlap of that expertise.  In my experience, it takes a lot of dedication to be a true expert at MTG, and that would be at the cost of expertise in other board and card games.  I, for one, &lt;em&gt;used to be&lt;/em&gt;, an expert in magic, but it's changed so much in the past 10 years that I would no longer consider myself one.  This ability to have expertise go stale isn't as much of an issue in other BCG.   If I haven't played the last 3 Dominion expansions, but was an expert in the first 2, I can 'catch up' with relatively little time and effort.  This is not the case with MTG where the game 'completely' changes due to new rules and card sets of a tremendous scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="587" LastActivityDate="2011-10-03T15:29:29.220" CommentCount="2" />

There's a liberal way, which wants to give questions the benefit of the doubt.  Unfortunately, it takes only 5 exponents of the conservative school to be active to close all &quot;borderline&quot; questions.  (I wish there was a &quot;don't close&quot; vote that could counteract a &quot;close&quot; one.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closing as not constructive requires the opinion that answers will not be able to be based on &quot;facts, references, or specific expertise&quot;.  Well, on the Bridge question in hand, there are definitely facts and references you can bring to bear, about bidding systems, transfers, the forcing nature of requests to transfer or otherwise.  Specific expertise is bound to be useful: a great Bridge player could have a lot to say about such a hand, how they might have bid it, what went wrong at the table in question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, this question doesn't definitely have a right answer.  But an awful lot of questions on BG:SE don't have a definite right answer.  If we want our site to have just simple fact-checking requests like &quot;how many points do you need to make a pre-empt bid in Standard American&quot; or &quot;what happens when you block a creature with Trample&quot; then that's fine, if unexciting.

There doesn't need to be any substance to the answer.  &lt;strong&gt;Nothing is learned, no experience needs to be shared.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Votes should indicate quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Too many answers&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't take an expert to recommend a game, anyone can do it.

As a newcomer to both Stack Exchange and the specific Board and Card games community, I noticed a disconnect between the questions FAQ and the actual most popular questions - specifically in regard to strategy. The FAQ roughly says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You should only ask practical, answerable questions . . . [not] open-ended questions . . . Your questions should be reasonably scoped.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet for Settlers of Catan, among the top 10 most popular questions are 5 strategy questions that are very open ended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My attempt to create my first question, a strategy question for Ticket to Ride, always resulted in &quot;The question you're asking appears subjective and is likely to be closed.&quot; Eventually I decided to word the question almost identically to a popular Settlers of Catan question and ignored the warning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, the FAQ should be changed to indicate that certain types of strategy questions are okay. Perhaps examples of good and bad questions could be given. The current community seems to like moderately scoped questions like &quot;In Settlers of Catan, how do you overcome bad initial settlement placement?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I'm guessing you don't want questions like &quot;What are some good Go strategies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2260" LastActivityDate="2012-01-05T18:02:33.010" CommentCount="4" />

Of course we'll get that to some degree with any type of question, simply because we're no different than any other online community in certain respects: we have standards which we expect all users to follow, and all internet sites experience a sort of entropy, in that their content will naturally tend to degrade over time, requiring constant effort to keep up quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's certainly worthwhile to do that for cases where it's the question itself that needs help, but when the topic is also a problem area, we can end up spending a significant amount of mod and user time just to end up with well-written questions that still don't fit the Stack Exchange format. We can spend a lot of time talking about the differences between &quot;what games are like X&quot; and &quot;what is the best game like X&quot;, for example, but that won't change the point of the question: tell me about a game like X. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And it's not as though we don't have a place where those questions can be asked. It's possible to have forum-like discussions in chat, and honestly, I think that's the best place for game-rec questions anyway. The best recommendations, in my opinion, come from people who a) know you well or b) know the type of game you're looking for well. Those attributes can be hard to identify in a Q&amp;amp;A format ... but they can be teased out with the back-and-forth nature of chat. (We also avoid the additional problem of extended discussion in comments: another area where it's hard to allow exceptions, because otherwise we spend a lot of time explaining the difference between an exception and a particular case.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1140" LastActivityDate="2012-01-05T21:47:13.307" CommentCount="1" />

That way, we use official sources without scraping, and have a methodology in place to expand to images if it becomes possible later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT II: THE RETURN OF EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; After some additional discussion in chat today, I propose a markdown syntax of &lt;code&gt;[mtg:cardname]&lt;/code&gt;.

In your SO example, I think that's a key difference between &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%23-4.0&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;c#-4.0&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;c#-4.0&lt;/a&gt; and the non-existent &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/c%23-polymorphism&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;c#-polymorphism&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;c#-polymorphism&lt;/a&gt; - the former is top-level, the latter is not.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tags should be as simple as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Tag conventions are great, but most users don't know or care about what they &quot;should&quot; be using. Most people would just tag &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bridge&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;bridge&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bidding&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;bidding&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;bidding&lt;/a&gt; and move on. Any policy that doesn't do what people expect needs to be considered carefully.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special conventions need maintenance.&lt;/strong&gt; The corollary to the previous point is that higher rep users will have to do more monitoring and retagging when non-obvious conventions are in use.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining game-specific tags is non-trivial.&lt;/strong&gt; How do you make the distinction between a tag that only applies to a single game, and one which is more general? It's impossible to guarantee that no other game has the concept of &quot;manabase&quot;. Even worse, they might have a similar mechanic, but call it something a bit different. Choosing where to draw that line with specialised tag naming is going to be endless.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One place where this might be a little different is the case of game expansions, and how they should be tagged.

If every Seafarers question is also about Settlers, do we accomplish anything by using both tags? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other part of the problem, I think, is that we don't have any &quot;series&quot; tags, so questions about a family of games are lumped in with the original game, and we end up with a number of questions that are, in effect, &quot;randomly&quot; tagged: they may apply to other games in the series as well, but aren't tagged that way because the OP doesn't have them ... and if we tag with each expansion, eventually we'll run out of tags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See these questions as examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/3192/1140&quot;&gt;Settlers of Catan -- warped board pieces&lt;/a&gt; - applies to all Settlers sets&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/3529/1140&quot;&gt;Can You Buy a Catan Border That Fits?&lt;/a&gt; - same&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/3829/1140&quot;&gt;Is drawing resources required?&lt;/a&gt; - specifically asks about Settlers, Cities and Knights, and Fishermen, but isn't tagged with Fishermen&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/settlers-of-catan-series&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'settlers-of-catan-series'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;settlers-of-catan-series&lt;/a&gt; tag would make it easier to tag questions like that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess after thinking it through, I support &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/169/1140&quot;&gt;Brian's position&lt;/a&gt; with a few suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Questions about a single expansion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/4830/1140&quot;&gt;Are progress cards awarded if the barbarian strength is 0?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/2570/1140&quot;&gt;Largest Army in Settlers of Catan: Cities and Knights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/6468/1140&quot;&gt;In Seafarers of Catan, are there any special rules for ships or harbors in lakes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do&lt;/strong&gt; tag with the expansion, even if it's included in the title.

But when he told me that it was based on some experience as a game designer and extensive experience as game tester, the answer improved even more for me as I wasn't sure if it was just a best guess or based on experience. In my mind, this convinced me that I should &quot;accept&quot; this answer (though I haven't quite yet in case a better answer comes along to this fresh question). So I suggested to Aramis in comments that he add the following sentence to his answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Based on a few games I've designed and extensive play-testing where suitability for children was a common designer question, here's what I've learned . . .&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aramis did not think this was a good line to add to the answer. He stated that, &quot;In fact, that's one of the things that, in my undergrad, we were taught to treat as a fallacy - anyone whose sources must include their bonafides in order to be credible is probably including them solely to be credible at all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not getting this.

This SE blog encourages the community to follow 6 principles developed by the moms4mom group. Here are principals 4 and 5:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;4: Great subjective questions invite sharing experiences over&#xA;  opinions. Certainly experiences inform opinions, but the best&#xA;  subjective questions unabashedly and unashamedly prioritize sharing&#xA;  actual experiences over random opinions. It’s more useful to share&#xA;  with us what you’ve done than what you think. Everyone has an opinon.&#xA;  It takes zero effort or imagination to have an opinion about anything&#xA;  and everything. But people who have done things, real things in the&#xA;  world, and have the scars and arrows in their back to show for it —&#xA;  now that’s worth sharing. You should be uniquely qualified to have&#xA;  your opinion based on the specific experiences you had. And you should&#xA;  share those experiences, and more specifically what you learned from&#xA;  your experiences, with us!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;5: Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with&#xA;  facts and references. Opinion isn’t all bad, so long as it’s backed up&#xA;  with something other than “because I’m an expert”, or “because I said&#xA;  so”, or “just because”. Use your specific experiences to back up your&#xA;  opinions, as above, or point to some research you’ve done on the web&#xA;  or elsewhere that provides evidence to support your claims. We like&#xA;  you. We want to believe you. But like wikipedia itself, {{citation&#xA;  needed}}. And good subjective questions make this clear from the&#xA;  outset: back it up!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key phrase in #5 is &quot;Use your specific experiences to back up your opinions&quot; and the key phrase in #4 is &quot;the best subjective questions unabashedly and unashamedly prioritize sharing actual experiences over random opinions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we're to follow the guidelines suggested in this SE blog post, then it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make sense to cite one's experience as related to a question and its answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An introduction like &quot;Based on a few games I've designed and extensive play-testing where suitability for children was a common designer question, here's what I've learned . . .&quot; would seem to be in the spirit of describing one's actual experiences that the answer is based on. It may not be the optimal wording (feel free to suggest improvements).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But an introduction like this does help provide the experiential context for the answer, and that makes the answer better for questions of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2260" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2014-04-23T13:46:50.313" LastActivityDate="2012-03-26T14:38:56.503" CommentCount="0" />

An homegrown hotlink system will likely never happen, for the reasons he provided.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: However, the Wizards-official AutoCard feature you suggest means that Kevin's answer should be reevaluated - given that it's an official API, it should alleviate all of their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondarily, if it is decided (for whatever reason) that the AutoCard definitely won't work (meaning we can't use the official API, and we almost certainly can't use image hotlinking for the reasons previously provided), I don't believe we've heard anything yet about &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/670/1328&quot;&gt;my suggestion&lt;/a&gt;.

Would highlighting new answers help with this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've answered 2 questions that were over a year old and already had 3 or more answers. In each case I did this because I thought I had a substantially better answer for games in which I have a lot of experience. The mechanics of stack exchange make new answers buried beneath many other answers and thus not noticed. The new answer is unlikely to be accepted as the question originator is often no longer participating in the site, or even if they are don't get voting information to help decide if the new question merits acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange was initially conceived for developers who had objective questions with typically one objective answer. But the way Board and Card Games has evolved, questions about strategy are popular and typically have multiple possible answers. Furthermore, rules change over time which can change the correct answer to a question (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/380/what-to-do-when-an-answer-is-no-longer-correct&quot;&gt;What to do when an answer is no longer correct?&lt;/a&gt;). As rules change, and more importantly as new people join the site who may have different (and sometimes better) strategy ideas, it would be great if there were a way to temporarily highlight a new answer so it could be seen and considered. If not bubbled to the top, perhaps a brightly colored link to the new answer that lasts for 3-6 days. This would provide an incentive for people who think they have a potentially better answer to post it to an older question - they'll know that there's a real chance people will see the answer and vote/comment on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/221/what-are-good-placement-strategies-for-stratego&quot;&gt;What are good placement strategies for Stratego?&lt;/a&gt; (I believe I can beat someone who always uses the strategy of the top answer at least 80% of the time, so I provided a competing answer)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/15/what-are-the-key-strategy-differences-between-settlers-of-catan-and-seafarers&quot;&gt;What are the key strategy differences between Settlers of Catan and Seafarers? &lt;/a&gt; (I agree with the top answer but it is not even close to comprehensive, so I provided a more comprehensive competing answer)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on the reception for my answers to these questions (few views, few votes, no comments), &lt;strong&gt;I am inclined to not answer old questions in the future&lt;/strong&gt; (that have more than 3 answers already).

This makes them awesome for picking up and playing, but it also means that most rules questions either are answered by reading the manual for a few minutes — we don't want to boost our counts with &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/are-some-questions-too-simple/&quot;&gt;general reference&lt;/a&gt;&quot; questions — or, if the situation is not covered in the manual, &lt;em&gt;are not objectively answerable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often the only real difference between a regular player who has read the rulebook and a &quot;rules expert&quot; is just that the expert also knows where to find the official FAQ and/or errata, or a more up-to-date version of the rulebook itself.  Short of getting one of the actual game designers/developers on here to answer questions, we have a rather limited supply of canonical documentation to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such questions obviously have their place on this site, and will continue to do so for as long as the site exists, but in and of themselves they are not enough for this site to reach the critical questions-asked mass to become successful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which begs the questions: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What makes a board-and-card-games expert better than normal people, and what would said normal people want to ask said board-and-card-games expert that they can't just ask someone else?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The obvious (to me) feature that separates many BCG experts from the laymen isn't the fact that they know the rules to any particular game very well — as mentioned above, anyone can do that without much difficulty — but rather that they know &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of games very well.  The questions that this type of expert would thrive at, where the layman would falter, would be any questions which tap into this breadth of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we really need is more &quot;game agnostic&quot; type questions, which don't require knowledge of one particular game so much as a strong knowledge of games in general.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Off the top of my head, there are three major categories of questions which would really capitalize on the knowledge of a BCG expert:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General/abstract strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game design and development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Game recommendations&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;There are probably many more categories that aren't currently on the top of my head&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this site to succeed, I feel we need to be cultivating these (properly scoped) types of questions, despite their tendency towards subjectivity.

You can't&#xA;have even teams, and turn-based games can feel slow unless turns are short. What characteristics can a turn-based game have so that it doesn't feel too slow with 5 people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good answer for this last question should cite some games (after all, answer from experience!), but specific games should not be the answer. For example, games like Dixit or Apples to Apples have have everyone involved on every turn, 7 Wonders uses simultaneous drafting so that people are taking their turns at the same time, and Citadels has very short turns, many of which have some interaction and suspense for everyone.

It seems to just pick the most commonly-used tag. That means that, if the rules tag is most questions on most games, you end up seeing &quot;rules - Interactions of multiple Parallel Lives&quot; rather &quot;magic the gathering - Interactions of multiple Parallel Lives&quot; (which is what's happening now, and it's less than ideal).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, I think tags like &lt;code&gt;rules&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strategy&lt;/code&gt; are useful. They provide at-a-glance information about the nature of a question. I think the &lt;code&gt;rules&lt;/code&gt; tag represents a conceptually sound, irreducible category: &lt;strong&gt;direct questions about how to interpret the game rules in play&lt;/strong&gt;. These questions may take the form of &quot;How do I apply this rule correctly in this situation?&quot; or &quot;Which rules apply in this situation?&quot; but I think those are both, fundamentally, the same kind of question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the tag's ridiculous popularity has more to do with the strengths of our site than with any kind of vagueness associated with the tag itself. In particular, &lt;strong&gt;BC&amp;amp;G.SE is one of the best resources for Magic rules questions on the Internet&lt;/strong&gt;. Our format is great for rules questions and our user base is very good at answering them with detailed, timely, and accurate responses. In contrast, BC&amp;amp;G.SE is pretty middle-of-the-road for other Magic content, such as deck-building and strategy. It stands to reason that we'd attract more MTG rules questions than other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see a way forward that involves deprecating &lt;code&gt;rules&lt;/code&gt; because:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no clear separation of &lt;code&gt;rules&lt;/code&gt; into distinct smaller concepts.

I challenge you to find one.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Simply retiring the tag and saying that all questions are &lt;code&gt;rules&lt;/code&gt; &quot;by default&quot; is a clunky workaround to what's practically a non-problem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1910" LastEditorUserId="1910" LastEditDate="2012-06-18T20:56:23.180" LastActivityDate="2012-06-18T20:56:23.180" CommentCount="5" />

For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/7333/combat-damage-and-1-1&quot;&gt;Combat damage and +1/+1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/6472/in-monopoly-is-it-ok-for-a-third-party-to-make-a-trade-with-a-player-who-is-abo&quot;&gt;In Monopoly, Is it OK for a third party to make a trade with a player who is about to lose?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/5354/can-routed-ships-retreat-to-port-in-the-same-sea-area&quot;&gt;Can routed ships retreat to port in the same sea area?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing that these above questions all have in common is that, rather than asking for clarifications on an existing rule, they're asking for someone who knows the rules to make a ruling.

For example &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/7438/2733&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; is valid in 5th edition, but not 6th.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While we don't currently have many 40K questions, questions that specifically apply to the older editions need to be marked as such to avoid confusion.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The RPG SE uses edition specific tagging, because of the great differences you find in between things like 2nd, 3rd and 4th edition D&amp;amp;D.  This is a similar situation.  Most miniature game edition changes follow similar patterns of large scale changes.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2733" LastEditorUserId="2733" LastEditDate="2012-07-03T14:06:25.437" LastActivityDate="2014-04-23T08:52:58.430" Title="Re-tag for Warhammer 40K Questions" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;tagging&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" />

However, I also am very interested in following certain types of questions such as strategy, game design, teaching/beginner, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) I use tags in combination with the Q to better understand what the Q is. In addition to the game name, if it's tagged as beginner than I should keep my answer simple (or avoid it altogether if I hate answering newbie Qs). If it is Bridge and it's tagged bidding, it may help me to more quickly figure out that this is a question about bidding, not declarer play. Far more useful would be specific bidding systems like &quot;standard-american&quot; or &quot;acol&quot; as I could then ignore what I don't know (acol) and only look at what I know (standard american).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I could not filter in the active view and quickly determine what a Q is about, I might have already given up as an active user as I have not played Magic the Gathering and several other popular games - it would be too much trouble to pick out Qs of interest to me for either reading/voting or answering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2260" LastEditorUserId="2260" LastEditDate="2012-08-28T17:51:55.647" LastActivityDate="2012-08-28T17:51:55.647" CommentCount="1" />

Different clubs have different default systems (Standard American is not universal even in the USA, and practically unheard of elsewhere); different books have different definitions of the system; different pairs have different understandings of the book.  There was originally a 'natural' meaning for each bid; but even if if still exists (doubtful), it doesn't cover any bid about which a question is likely to be asked. For example, a take-out double is clearly a conventional bid; when to make it depends on what your system prescribes. As one commenter on the example said, 'You think it's a textbook bid to make: I think it's a textbook bid to avoid. We may be using different textbooks'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would it be helpful to replace the 'bidding' tag with a set of sub-tags, (perhaps 'bidding standard-american', 'bidding acol', 'bidding precision' and 'bidding non-conventional')?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or should we discourage this sort of question entirely?  They may be too localised to be of value to future enquirers; the point-count for a specific bid will be affected by what point-count is required/permitted for other bids, which may mean the question requires a book-length answer; and they do by their nature require discussion and advice, rather than the clear objective answer SO sites usually look for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I don't mean to sound pompous, still less to criticize TomAu; but I think the point should be discussed.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1644" LastActivityDate="2012-08-25T04:57:28.850" Title="Bidding tags for bridge questions" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;tags&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="2" />

You might want to examine the total number of questions that a creation date of 1 year+, that have an edit within the last 3-6 months. Then look at the ratio of new answers to no new answers (determine how likely you are to recieve a new answer, or examine the total up votes for those new answers versus the highest answer older than 3-6+ months (determine how good new answers are). My guess is that you will find that new/late answers are pretty poor in general.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1873" LastActivityDate="2012-08-25T14:03:27.360" CommentCount="0" />

Jeff Atwood wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/&quot;&gt;post about meta tags&lt;/a&gt; that was referenced in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/10/1140&quot;&gt;older discussion about tagging here&lt;/a&gt;. It contains the following definition of meta tags, courtesy of Aaronut on meta.cooking: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Meta-tags are actually a subset of a larger problem that I usually call dependent tags. These are tags that don’t say anything by themselves – you can’t tell what the question is about unless they’re paired with some other tag (or several of them). These tags are a problem because people don’t realize this and will often use that as the question’s only tag. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meta tags tend to cause two types of problems: they squeeze out tags that would otherwise be applied to the question (and thus need a second pass to be tagged properly), and they cause confusion as to what, exactly, they mean. From Jeff's post:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Best practices to whom? Beginner by what criteria?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is such a tagged question for beginners at that game? What about people with experience in similar games, but none with that particular game? How much experience makes you more than just a beginner? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why would someone follow the beginner tag? No one has enough experience with all games to be able to answer beginner questions on all games; neither would someone be interested in beginner's questions for all games. The tag itself is meaningful only in combination with other tags, but cannot be followed in combination with other tags. Yes, it may assist you with respect to searching ... but would a question for beginners not also contain the word &quot;beginner&quot; itself? Tags are not intended to be substitutes for searching &amp;ndash; we already have that ability. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Number of followers is a useful metric for evaluating tags: ideally, we would look at something like views per followed tag vs. views per non-followed tag, but that's really not possible, because one advantage of following/ignoring is that you can scroll through questions without clicking and still get an idea of the ones you're more/less interested in. (That is, essentially, what I believe tags are designed to do; they also serve as a funnel for searching, so that people don't have to try five different spellings of a particular game to get all the questions for it.) Let's look at the first page of tags on the main site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rules&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'rules'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; has 5 followers and 455 questions. That's generally an indicator of meta-ness, and of course &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rules&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'rules'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; isn't a game called &quot;rules&quot; (which, btw, is one reason to avoid meta tags on sites like these: it can cause confusion if we end up getting questions on such a game). Does that tag give you any indication as to whether or not you might be able to answer the question? No. It just suggests that the question is about rules ... as would most questions be on a site like this. (See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.rpg.stackexchange.com/q/363/1636&quot;&gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt; on RPG meta.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/magic-the-gathering&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'magic-the-gathering'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;magic-the-gathering&lt;/a&gt; has 99 followers and 391 questions.

I'm not seeing much value from the extra tags. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I would say the purpose is to link questions to the game or games about which they're asked, or to a topic like &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/history&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'history'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; if the question is not game-specific but is also on-topic for the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1140" LastEditorUserId="1140" LastEditDate="2012-09-17T17:26:13.460" LastActivityDate="2012-09-17T17:26:13.460" CommentCount="0" />

In &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/267/1140&quot;&gt;November 2010&lt;/a&gt;, we talked a little bit about how to get our numbers up.

Some just deal with it better ... and some have an easier time of it because of their audience. (Arqade, for example.) Either way, our goal has to be reaching a sustainable volume of good questions that can get us out of beta: if we seed questions, at some point we'll run out. If we lower the quality threshold, then even if we do get out of beta, we become just another site, with the added bonus of having to explain why these old questions were all closed while these new questions are allowed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think Alex has the right idea - more people asking more questions about more games. goldPseudo touches on some of the problem, that there are a lot of games that are designed not to bring up questions. (Chutes and Ladders, right?) But there are plenty of games that &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; bring up questions, as we've seen with MTG. We just need to tap those audiences (uh, not in a MTG sense), and that means pretty much the same thing it does for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Individually, we can promote the site through social media, especially by posting questions that need answers. We probably all are connected to people who play games but aren't here yet, and maybe seeing a question they can answer will draw them here. We can remember to ask questions here when they come up while we're playing games ... but again, these should be good questions, not questions-for-the-sake-of-asking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also like &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/340/1140&quot;&gt;Pat's suggestion&lt;/a&gt; from the Top-7 question: work with cons when we can. Drawing questions from attendees themselves is a great idea, although we would have to emphasize that they won't necessarily get an immediate answer (i.e. we're not a replacement for GMs) even if we make more of an effort to watch for questions during cons. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is a smaller con in your area, you might be able to work with the mods and SE so that BCG can be represented there. (Larger cons probably require more advance planning and more work. I've been looking for an excuse to go to Gen Con, which is local to me, but as Pat points out, the ROI for us may not be worth it.) In a sense, game nights at home are baby cons: we can use those as an excuse to post questions here when they come up (again, real, high-quality questions, not things like &quot;Can I move forward with a 4 in Sorry?&quot;), and maybe get one or two new people to check out the site as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that is really about time and effort.

It'd be better to have that consensus be explicitly stated here on meta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove the tags on older questions&lt;/strong&gt; - Over the last few months, due to normal front page rotation, the count of &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rules&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'rules'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; has decreased over 10%.  However that still leaves 438 as of this writing, and another 161 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/strategy&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'strategy'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you agree with me that these tags should go, feel free to join in on my effort.   Ideally we don't want to flood the front page with old questions.  But something like 5 at a time is cool.  Then pause for a few hours, see if those old questions get pushed down again and do 5 more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could note a couple new questions that need editing, but first, clean up some older questions, then edit the new ones to put them back on top.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe slow and steady will win this race.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify other meta tags&lt;/strong&gt; - I'm sure there are more.  For new nominations, please put them in an answer (1 per) to allow debate.  If we get consensus, we'll edit them in here on the question and open season on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Removed meta-tags:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm deleting the answers for the below to focus attention on the open discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/two-players&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'two-players'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;two-players&lt;/a&gt; suggested by Shujaa&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/setup&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'setup'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;setup&lt;/a&gt; suggested by bwarner&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40" LastEditorUserId="40" LastEditDate="2012-12-12T04:36:59.327" LastActivityDate="2012-12-12T04:36:59.327" Title="Meta tags 'R Us!"

Until there are enough people who naturally hang out in chat, people have to &quot;seed&quot; it by making more of an effort to hang out there and talk about things ... or even to play. (Depending on the game, players may want a separate room. Random comments may work better in some play-by-chat games than others.) And it's not like seeding the main site by asking questions we really aren't facing, because this is simply making people more available in case someone drops by for whatever reason ... quality of conversation in chat isn't at all the same type of issue as quality of questions on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think this is much different than asking how to grow the site in general, because everything basically depends on everything else. Chat becomes more active with more people on the site. More people means more questions, more answers, and more meta activity. More people in chat means more off-topic questions diverted there (because there's actually someone around to answer, or to try to answer; it doesn't sound quite the same to say &quot;you can ask this in chat, though&quot; when no one is there to help) and more conversation. More conversation in chat can lead to more questions on the main site. It's just hard when the site hasn't yet reached critical mass and it isn't clear how we can get more active participants on the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1140" LastActivityDate="2012-10-08T18:36:56.290" CommentCount="0" />

How good? Try 2x!  Visits have doubled during each of those periods.  Better yet, we've kept that level of traffic each year and continued to build upon it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see Christmas is being held again this year so I have no reason to suspect that it won't happen again!  That gives us 60 days to put our best foot forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;The Goal&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Get launched!  Take a look at all of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic&quot;&gt;StackExchange sites&lt;/a&gt; sorted by traffic.  At a high level I notice a couple things&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Above 5k visits/day most sites are launched&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Below 4.5k visits/day most sites are not launched&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Our traffic is currently 2.3k visits/day&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't spoken to and SE staff about this, but it looks like that if our traffic can double we will be right in the sweet spot where the question switches from, &quot;When are we going to launch?&quot; to &quot;Why aren't we launched already?&quot;  &lt;strong&gt;I'd like to force the question, who's with me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Sounds good, what can we do now?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are my ideas, please comment and expand!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Vote early, vote often!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One slightly disturbing trend I've noticed this year is a decrease in voting.  Since the end of January we've increased traffic by 2x.  Unfortunately, during that time, voting has decreased by 50%.  Taken together votes per visit was 4x higher at the beginning of the year.  I think we can do better, lets reward people that contribute to this site by asking good questions and giving great answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note - &lt;em&gt;I'm not encouraging anyone to blindly upvote everything they come across.&lt;/em&gt;  Take a moment, evaluate the question or answer and then up &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; down vote appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badges:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/28/electorate&quot;&gt;Electorate&lt;/a&gt;: One of the easiest gold badges to receive.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/58/sportsmanship&quot;&gt;Sportsmanship&lt;/a&gt; - Vote for answers that aren't yours.

Anyone can obtain this with one day's worth of voting.

That doesn't mean we shouldn't try.  Share an occasional link on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, etc.  I think it works best if you share one that you were involved in or that helped you directly so that you can relate your personal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're active on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; or similar sites, go ahead and drop a link where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badges:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/54/announcer&quot;&gt;Announcer&lt;/a&gt; - Bronze, we only have 14 of these.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/55/booster&quot;&gt;Booster&lt;/a&gt; - Silver, we have but 2&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/56/publicist&quot;&gt;Publicist&lt;/a&gt; - Gold, we have 1&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Challenge&lt;/em&gt; - Booster and Publicist are pretty hard, but can we double the Announcers?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Improve/Elaborate/expand&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Editing is a largely thankless task.  Fortunately we have many people who have been eager to improve posts, even ones that aren't their own.  Of course there is always more we can do.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of our hits come right from Google.  This means that people are ending up here looking for answers to their questions.  &lt;em&gt;This is awesome&lt;/em&gt;, we have to make sure they get the information they need and hopefully plant a seed of curiosity that will bring them back here when they have a question they can't find the answer to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that almost any post can be improved.  While fixing spelling and obvious grammar problems have significant value, we stand to gain a lot more when a good editor strips a post down and rebuilds it in a clear, concise manner.  I encourage everyone who may enjoy this to give it a try.  Turnover on our front page isn't too fast and almost every edit will have other people looking at it quickly.  If there's a problem, any edit can be reverted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/33/copy-editor&quot;&gt;Copy Editor&lt;/a&gt;, 500 edited posts is a lot, I'm only a bit over half way there.

The more traffic we have, the better the answers will get.  We'll also get more questions and some of them will be more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Making the world a better place.  Several times over the last year I've googled questions and ended up right back here.  People all over the world are doing this on a daily basis.  A lot of them end up here and get quick, great answers to their questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games!&lt;/strong&gt; - Yes, I'll be giving away at least one game.  If you earn one of the badges mentioned above by December 15th @ midnight CST you will be entered to win a game from my personal collection.  I'll spend up to $25 shipping it to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also listed 3 challenges above.  For each challenge that is achieved in the same period I'll add another game to the pot.  There could be a maximum of 4 winners (1 game each).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other rules&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rules can change at any time at my discretion. The only rule that can't change is that I will give away one game to a member of this site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Winner(s) to be determined at my discretion.  This will likely involve me rolling dice at my desk. &lt;strong&gt;There may be no independent verification of results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Each person can only win one game&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Achieving Silver or Gold badges improves your odds of winning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Anyone who gets a mod message from the other mods will be disqualified.

There a lot of things that can be qualified as &quot;list questions&quot;. But only some of them are unacceptable and don't entirely work. Even your examples in #2 I wouldn't consider the problem to necessarily be that they are a list, but perhaps one of scope. As for unacceptability, I refer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/997/handling-game-recommendations-how-can-we-solve-these-two-problems-of-quality&quot;&gt;this post of mine that bwarner linked already&lt;/a&gt; as a good starting read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the problem you're trying to determine here seems to be more about when there are multiple possible answers to a question, and not that it is an endless repository of options. Let's lay down some ground points then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is perfectly acceptable for there to be more than one correct answer to a question&lt;/strong&gt;. This is why we even have a voting system at all, and why we allow multiple answers. This does not mean that &quot;Of these three cards, which is the best for a drain deck?&quot; should have three answers, though.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the answer a question needs is a list, then the list should fit in one answer&lt;/strong&gt;. An example I use from Arqade is &quot;Where do I find all of the subtanks in Megaman ZX?&quot;. There are exactly four of these - a proper answer will list all four. This should not get four answers, one for each location.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The word &quot;best&quot; in a title is not an instant condemnation sign&lt;/strong&gt;. Implicitly, any question asking for the solution to a problem is seeking the best solution to that problem. A question whose core is still fully legitimate, just the presence of the word &quot;best&quot; is irksome, that is still a legitimate question. This does not mean that this question should get a separate answer for every possible best option, though.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a resonating point that I made in all of these. Which is that a lot of questions will benefit a lot more from a comprehensive answer that covers multiple points, than one that just covers a single one. The conclusion can still be a single one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let us look at your two examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the best spell for a multiplayer drain deck, Drain Life, Exsanguinate, or Bond of Agony&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A great answer to this question will cover all three cards, explain the advantages to each one, and either come to a conclusion of a single card being more universally useful or a conclusion on which scenarios will make which cards shine. A good answer will highlight one card and explain why it is more useful than the other two. A meh answer will just name a card and notate why it is good. A bad answer will just name one card.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there opinion? Yes, but the more opinionated an answer is, the less helpful an answer is. The more fundamental and fact-backed an answer is, the more useful it is to other people and thus the more rated it will be. What makes this still a helpful question is that there still &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the room for fact-backed answers. At least, in theory. I don't know these cards so I have no idea, but my assumption is that the root question is as such.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the best spell for a multiplayer drain deck?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we start cutting things down, what's happening is that the scope is losing helpfulness. When you reach this point, an asker should be thinking, &quot;Is the answer too situational for this question to be helpful to others?&quot; I don't know drain decks well, but for example, &quot;What is the best set of Slivers for a Sliver deck?&quot; is too broad. Sliver deck is a strategy, certainly, but it also makes use of other strategies. Do you go Shadow/Poison and go for direct player kill? Do you go stat-stacking and overwhelm by Power/Toughness monstrosities? The reason Slivers work is because you have a lot of options that all work with a core theme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this illustrates my point well enough. It's been too long since I played a deck that I know an example that isn't too broad. But the basic point is, you don't need to specify &quot;What is the best out of these options&quot; and can instead opt for &quot;What are the best options for this strategy?&quot; if the latter question is narrow enough in scope that the answers will be genuinely helpful. This can be the case even if there is more than one opinion on the answer - the ultimate core of the question is &quot;How can I accomplish this strategy?&quot;, which you'll note the lack of &quot;best&quot; but it will still get the same answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the best black multiplayer spell?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is when it obviously gets to be too broad. I don't think I need to cover this in more depth beyond what I said in the previous point. At this point, though, the scope is so large that it illustrates the problem most people think of with lists. That is, because there isn't a narrow guideline, all people have to go on in answering this is their opinions. Factual stricture like saying &quot;Well, for this strategy, the best option is...&quot; starts to get away from the question that was actually asked.

Please note that this is not an official Stack Exchange response. I'm just an (unelected) &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators&quot;&gt;moderator of this site&lt;/a&gt;, and a SE user of &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/users/48396/ire-and-curses?tab=accounts&quot;&gt;some experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; for a site's success to have a broad user base. Critical mass is everything. A user should expect to be interested in some small subset of the total remit of a site. A site should be as wide as possible, but no wider. It's not necessary to make hard delineations between sites. It is not yet known how to correctly decompose knowledge between sites, but there are some hypotheses, and the experiments are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Rationale&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we know where to draw the boundaries of an SE site?&lt;/strong&gt; That's a tricky question, with lots of grey areas. The Stack Exchange approach has been to &quot;try it and see&quot;: proposals are made at &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Area 51&lt;/a&gt;, people try and refine scope, and if they reach critical mass, they launch. Importantly, these proposals, and the subsequent implemented sites, &lt;em&gt;need not be distinct sets&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, a question about the programmer's text editor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; might be on topic on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vim&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/vim&quot;&gt;Unix and Linux&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/vim&quot;&gt;Ask Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;. This is because knowledge in the real world has fuzzy boundaries, and doesn't fit into a strict hierarchy, as ontologists and the field of AI has &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepowerofpull.com/pull/foundations/ontologies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;come to learn the hard way&lt;/a&gt;, over a period of many years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Board and Card Games itself has overlap. We allow questions about computer implementations of board games, even though these are also on topic at &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaming.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Arqade&lt;/a&gt;. We also overlap with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://poker.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Poker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://chess.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Chess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/11942/game-of-go&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; sites (the latter now defunct, and merged with B&amp;amp;CG). There is significant disagreement within the SE community about whether or not these distinct sites are necessary, what we gain or lose by merging, etc. etc. There are no easy answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the real question is &lt;strong&gt;what does a site's scope gain us&lt;/strong&gt;? The key here is &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;. You want a critical mass of quality contributors who can ask and answer questions well, so that the site can become self-sustaining, while generating high-quality content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your question you define three broad areas of game, and imply that there isn't much overlap between them. I disagree. People that like board games often play many different kinds of games. Take a look at the answers of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/users&quot;&gt;top contributors&lt;/a&gt; to see that demonstrated. The connecting thread here is the &lt;em&gt;gaming&lt;/em&gt; - how to define interesting problems or representations of the world, and how to solve them well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We make a distinction with video games, because the nature of the gaming, and the community, is completely different. We make a distinction with roleplaying, because while there is a fuzzy boundary, the big concerns of serious open-ended roleplaying games are significantly different (e.g. character development, immersiveness, creativity) from most board games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vocal communities for &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chess&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'chess'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/poker&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'poker'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;poker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/go&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'go'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;go&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/magic-the-gathering&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'magic-the-gathering'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;magic-the-gathering&lt;/a&gt; have all argued that they are '&lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt;', that their game is particularly deep, that they are largely uninterested in other board games, and that experts will shun a site which does not exclusively cater to their game.

The Chess and Poker sites continue to exist in Beta for now, but have their own challenges, just as we do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the key to a successful SE site scope is to &lt;em&gt;be as wide as possible, but no wider&lt;/em&gt;. Stack Overflow has great scope because it allows any programmer to ask any technical question about programming, in any language. Arqade works because it covers all video games, on all platforms. I think Board and Card Games works because it covers all aspects of all board and card games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's really important to understand that most of the users of these sites don't interact with most of the questions! We all have our niches. On Stack Overflow, I only care about the two or three programming languages I use regularly. On Arqade, I completely ignore questions about Xbox games. I don't have the console, I can't answer them, and they aren't relevant to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'll note that site scope is a work in progress. It's meta discussions here that help us to &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/656/should-we-ban-game-recommendation-questions-done&quot;&gt;define what is and isn't acceptable&lt;/a&gt;, and that definition can and will evolve over time. For now, I see no argument for increased specificity.

Just because the &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5220/board-and-card-games&quot;&gt;metric expects 2.5 answers per question&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; mean we should add unnecessary extra answers to questions! These are just aggregate broad-brush metrics, and they are inherently limited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you point out, there are a couple of ways to view wrong answers. A wrong answer that &lt;em&gt;looks right&lt;/em&gt; can be actively harmful if a reader took away the impression that it was correct. On the other hand, a wrong answer that is subtle or easy to arrive at has value in being present, since it marks the common error. There are also gradations; sometimes an answer is &lt;em&gt;mostly right&lt;/em&gt;, or only right under common circumstances, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a site mechanic perspective, the intention seems to be to encourage deletion. If you leave a wrong answer up it will tend to be downvoted, accrue challenging comments, and so on, which you may not enjoy. There are also two badges (&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/19/disciplined&quot;&gt;Disciplined&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/badges/20/peer-pressure&quot;&gt;Peer Pressure&lt;/a&gt;) which explicitly reward you for deleting answers when you believe they aren't helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, in this case I think the answer is very subtle. It was clear that most people thought you were correct, until the other answer showed up with the official ruling. In this situation, I think you would do best to edit your answer to indicate that you are aware it is incorrect, but that it is nevertheless a common misconception (you can point out exactly why as well, if you like). That should protect you from further downvotes while preserving a useful piece of information for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, it's up to you.

For example, in the history of magic, every single spider printed (except for &lt;a href=&quot;http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2976&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one very old card&lt;/a&gt;) has some kind of hate towards flying creatures. Why? Because spider webs catch flies, of course! Another example of flavor would be &lt;a href=&quot;http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249706&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mogg Flunkies&lt;/a&gt; - they're bigger than they should be for their cost, but they can't attack by themselves. Why? Well the flavor is they need someone smart enough to tell them what to attack, because they're really, really dumb.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flavor of things isn't just in the cards, but often in the game itself. Magic doesn't have a deck, it has a &quot;library&quot;. There's no discard pile, there's a &quot;graveyard&quot;. These are all considered forms of flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question is: are questions that enquire about flavor permitted on BCG? Example questions might be &quot;What is the flavor of Planeswalkers going to the graveyard?&quot; or &quot;What is the flavor behind &lt;a class=&quot;mtg-autocard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wizards.com/magic/autocard.asp?name=Forced%20Fruition&quot;&gt;Forced Fruition&lt;/a&gt;?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1500" LastEditorUserId="50" LastEditDate="2013-07-16T03:25:25.030" LastActivityDate="2013-07-16T04:55:13.520" Title="Are questions about flavor acceptable?"

It implements all the rules of the standard game, including the scoring, with only one thing missing: pluggable strategy methods for each player. Students have two weeks to formulate their strategies and write their code for choosing a (legal) card to play from a hand, and choosing which color to &quot;call&quot; if they play a wild.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to actually try implementing some different strategies too determine how effective they were. I tried &lt;strong&gt;call&lt;/strong&gt; random color, color I have, color I have most of, color with most points, and &lt;strong&gt;play&lt;/strong&gt; strategies with similar algorithms versus each other and the dominant strategy included in the software package &lt;strong&gt;rbrown4&lt;/strong&gt; (a card counting algorithm, with some card weighting based upon hand sizes. I found that there was little difference between the card counter and just playing a random playable card, and calling a color you actually have (less than 5% in a 3-player game), but I also discovered some issues with the simulator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random isn't random enough: A proper pseudo random number generator (PRNG) needs a period larger than the possible game states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules weren't implemented correctly: The simulator tracks points won per hand, not wins from acquiring 500 points. Draw cards played when going out don't add those drawn cards to your point total when you go out. Starting card effects are not allowed. Draw-4 wilds are allowed to be played when you have a playable color (and no &quot;caught&quot;/bluff is implemented)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game state doesn't track the most useful variables: I would like to track cards played by a player, how close they are to 500 points, what colors/ranks they have drawn on, etc. but the current implementation leaves much of this information inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have corrected most of these issues and rerun the simulator with improved results. Previously when playing random cards and calling random colors would only result in a difference of about 10% points versus a card counter/most color strategy, the win percentage increased by 30% in a 3-player game (versus 2 random players). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I ask a new question focused exclusively on how effective each strategy is?&lt;/strong&gt; (or should I edit the original question to clarify what is meant by &lt;strong&gt;most important&lt;/strong&gt; strategy?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If I ask a new question, how should I word it?&lt;/strong&gt; - I am interested to see how effective strategies like &lt;strong&gt;always change a called color&lt;/strong&gt; are, but can that strategy be singled out in a vacuum?

Someone has build an Uno simulator (link), and I want to create several different strategies and have them play against each other to see what works best. (Optional: add your bit about fixing the simulator. Keep it short, because that's not the important part about this question.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So: what is your Uno strategy? Be specific: I'm going to write a program to execute your strategy, and have it play against other strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things to think about in your answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What card do you play next? Do you try to get down to one color or number, or always keep as much variety as possible in your hand? If you have a pair of 0's and a 9, do you play the 9 to reduce your point count, or play a 0 to keep up some variety in your hand? Do you play Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, and Wild Draw Four early or late, or does it depend on how many cards other people have?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What do you do if you must change color, but you have multiple options on what to change to? Do you think about what opponents might have, or just go for what's most advantageous to you?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Does your strategy change if someone is very close to winning the entire match, i.e. somebody's close to 500 points? How close to 500 do they have to be for you to change how you play?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Does your strategy change if you're losing the hand? How do you decide if you're losing? (Do you start ditching the high-point cards like Wild and Draw Two?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you ever challenge someone's use of Wild Draw Four, by demanding they show that they don't have any cards of the current color? When do you challenge?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't worry about answering all of those questions, but if you change your play depending on circumstances around the table, please mention it in your answer. Being precise helps me program a strategy that matches what you do, but if some of it is a &quot;gut feel,&quot; just give me a general idea of what helps you make of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't worry about having the absolute best answer.&lt;/strong&gt; I will program your strategy, and edit your answer to show its actual win-rate against other strategies.

That's a total of seven instead of six VPs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That, to me, addressed the key point of the question (about &quot;interaction&quot; effects), that the other, mostly excellent answer, had left out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's true that the earlier versions were less clear.

But how to&#xA;  distinguish solitaire games from puzzles? I believe the criterion&#xA;  would be that solitaire games essentially produce an endless or large&#xA;  variety of different puzzles through randomization (most solitaire&#xA;  card games involve just shuffling a deck of cards, solitaire or coop&#xA;  games might involve rolling dice or other forms of randomization),&#xA;  while puzzles are static and new puzzles in a particular category&#xA;  (such as Sudoku or crosswords) must be created by another person or&#xA;  computer. I would, however, say that questions about puzzles that are&#xA;  specifically related to a board or card game, and commonly used in&#xA;  training for playing board and card games, would be OK; for instance,&#xA;  &quot;I'm working on this chess problem, and the book lists this solution,&#xA;  but I just can't figure out why this other line of play doesn't work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My opinion is that games which are completely luck-based are fine to ask about. Although strategy and tactics are non-existent, there are still reasonable questions about rules, probabilities, differences between editions, history, terminology, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By their nature, questions on these games will tend to be rarer, but that's fine too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At some level the off-topic dividing line is arbitrary. All games fall somewhere on the continuum between pure skill and pure luck. If pure luck games are excluded, what about games that are &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; entirely luck? In other words, there is no &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; reason to ban these questions; explicitly denying one end of the spectrum is unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastActivityDate="2013-10-10T16:11:00.983" CommentCount="0" />

I can see how vaugue questions like &quot;I like Settlers of Catan. What would be a good game to buy next&quot; are basically a popularity poll and have little value, as we couldnt really rate answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there are recommendation questions that make sense. I feel &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/13468/less-amerithrash-eclipse-alternatives&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; was one of them. I was &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; specific. I pinpointed the mechanics/game dynamics I disliked. I stated what do I consider a game similar to Eclipse. &lt;strong&gt;This leaves room for easy evaluation of answers&lt;/strong&gt; suggesting some games as the solution of my problem. Does the game fix the issues I find in Eclipse? What mechanic is supposed to do that and how? Does the game fufill the requirements of being similar to Eclipse that I posted? &lt;strong&gt;The specificity of my question eliminates the answer flood problem&lt;/strong&gt; - if there were so many games meeting my criteria, why would I even bother asking? Lets not ie to ourselves here - using the BGG mechanics search engine I had trouble finding games I know well and know percisely what mechanics they use. And im quite a tech savvy guy, being a programmer and all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cutting out the rules lawyering part, almost everything on the topic of boardgames is subjective. Some design solutions in a game may influence the gameplay experience of different individuals in different ways. Everything in a game depends on our perception. One might say Race for the Galaxy is solitaire, others might find a lot if indirect interaction in it. Can we objectively discuss design solutions used in the game? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stack exchange started as stackoverflow, and many of the faq's and rules are a modified copy of stackoverflows faq's and rules. While for SO they work fine, they are not the best choice for all topics. Take programmers SE! Take Role playing games beta! Take parenting SE! All these could be argued to be totally subjective, but they worked out their own sets of rules and they are functional!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also disagree with @user1873 comment on how BGG is better suited for game recommendations. Well, for the ultra broad ones, like the &quot;Settlers...&quot; example i gave earlier, that might be true. But for qeustions that are concrete enough to have answers that can objectively be rated? I dont think so. Asking on BGG I'd have to dig through 200+ answers, most of which would be clueless, jokes or off-topic chatter. SE format would spare me that and leave me just the few best answers at the top, each a enclosed whole, not referring to what someone said 37 pages earlier in the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the argumentation provided in the link to the Arcade SE site...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;First, Repositories are often non-finite; many will continue to be updated as new information comes up. Building from that, Repositories also tend to be non-static; the other question classes have a far less frequent rate of change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;well guess what... Most questions on StackOverflow have exactly the same problem! With new technologies showing up at every corner, questions on how to deal with a specific problem will indeed raise a list of answers, each proposing the usage of the new, cool and shiny tool. As the tools proliferate, so will technically correct answers. Some will get outdated, others wont. Taking it all into account, we still see that StackOverflow is doing pretty well, right? And lots of other concerns about the &quot;repository&quot; thing look like problems with the answers not following any discipline, and not the questions being bad themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There is no motivation to excel and be an expert in building Repositories here. Otherwise, these Repositories should be filled to the brim with pages upon pages of contributions. So we are really just providing a small subset of qualifying content, namely the subjectively and currently popular content. Including myself, there are many people who continue to state that game recommendations can be founded on knowledge and that there exists expertise, but these past two months have shown quite clearly that nobody seems to care about making a good quality repository that is founded on knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sooo... we only accept questions that are easy to answer in the correct way instead of fighting to have good answers to all questions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I would like to point out that our field is quite different form computer games. In boardgames, you directly interact with the games inner workings, and its a LOT easier to intelligently discuss them. We can for example reasonably compare games of the same genere, while in computer games it would probably get reduced to &quot;which game looks better or has a cooler storyline!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do agree that it is quite easy to wirte a bad recommendation question, but I feel there is a knee-jerk reaction to recommendation questions. Something like &quot;So your looking for a game that... wait wiat. Alert! Alert! Vote close!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am fully aware I wont sway your opinions, but I wanted to express what I think and state my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5223" LastActivityDate="2013-11-13T02:25:20.853" CommentCount="5" />

By allowing (most of) those sites to be created, Stack Exchange essentially decided to do the experiments to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A frustrating side-effect of that decision is that although chess questions are on topic here, users tend to ask them on the chess site, because of a perception that they are somehow 'more' on-topic there. This actively hinders the growth of a community of chess experts on this site, since 'serious' players will prefer the other site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The history of these decisions is summarised in &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/995/50&quot;&gt;Are we (as the Board and Card Game StackExchange) too broad in defining ourselves?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stack Exchange's rationale is explained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/1019/why-do-chess-and-poker-have-separate-sites-even-though-they-are-clearly-board-a&quot;&gt;Why do chess and poker have separate sites even though they are clearly “board and card games?”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My opinion is that these sites do not need to be distinct, and that distinction is not helping anyone. I believe both sites have smaller communities as a result of this balkanisation. We also suffer in terms of features and support. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;No chess board rendering.&lt;/strong&gt; We have been told in &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/978/please-implement-the-chess-replayer-on-board-and-card-games&quot;&gt;Please implement the chess replayer on Board and Card Games&lt;/a&gt; that if we require nice chess board rendering, we would be best served by asking our questions on chess.SE, not here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;No support for displaying hands of cards&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite a large card game following here, including bridge and poker, we do not have support for playing cards. This is standard on poker.SE (see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://poker.stackexchange.com/questions/2736/hand-discussion-qjc-vs-a8o-on-a84-t-k&quot;&gt;Hand discussion: QJc vs A8o on A84 T K&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I suspect that the uncertainty surrounding the future of the other gaming sites, the consequent vague responses from SE, and the continued lack of support and feature commitment to B&amp;amp;CG is part of the reason that &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/1112/50&quot;&gt;we continue to languish in endless Beta&lt;/a&gt;. Stack Exchange hasn't decided what to do here. For the forseeable future, the decision continues to be deferred.

Might there be a way to have this kind of thing formatted to show just the ampersand and not the encoded version?  If the link actually uses an &quot;&amp;amp;&quot;, it would produce a query of simply &quot;r&quot; (cutting off the ampersand itself and all following characters).  But if the link uses the concatenated &quot;&amp;amp;&quot; + &quot;amp;&quot; that the auto-linker changes this to, Gatherer produces &quot;rampds secret lair&quot; as the query, which is also invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7438" LastEditorUserId="7438" LastEditDate="2014-04-29T16:29:46.770" LastActivityDate="2014-06-26T23:17:37.113" Title="Can the Magic card auto link feature be improved?"

Another problem I've noticed, affecting both my solution and the one proposed by Alex P, is that some people have apparently taken to working around the apostrophe problem by just dropping the &lt;code&gt;'s&lt;/code&gt; from card names, e.g. writing &lt;a class=&quot;mtg-autocard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wizards.com/magic/autocard.asp?name=Pharika%20Mender&quot;&gt;Pharika Mender&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a class=&quot;mtg-autocard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wizards.com/magic/autocard.asp?name=Pharika%27s%20Mender&quot;&gt;Pharika&amp;#39;s Mender&lt;/a&gt;.  Currently, the mangled card names produce working links &amp;mdash; but if the auto-linking feature is changed as proposed in this thread, they'll stop working, even as the correct card names will start to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not a major issue if this change is done in the SE codebase, since we can just go and edit any such links to make them work again.  However, it kind of an obstacle to my plans to include this as a client-side fix in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackapps.com/questions/4486/stack-overflow-unofficial-patch&quot;&gt;SOUP&lt;/a&gt; user script, since there seems to be no way to write such links that would work &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; for users with and without the script. :-(&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Also, wouldn't it be really nice if we could actually have these links working in the post preview...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mtg-autocard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wizards.com/magic/autocard.asp?name=%20Testing%20a%20card%20name%20with%20%26lt%3b%20funny%20%3e%20characters&quot;&gt; Testing a card name with &amp;amp;lt; funny &amp;gt; characters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;mtg-autocard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wizards.com/magic/autocard.asp?name=Nested%20%5bmtg%3acard&quot;&gt;Nested [mtg:card&lt;/a&gt; links]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2203" LastEditorUserId="2203" LastEditDate="2014-06-13T21:51:50.580" LastActivityDate="2014-06-13T21:51:50.580" CommentCount="0" />

Your question, in essence, is asking&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there a [formal or mathematical] term for the idea that &quot;it's always better to keep your options open&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't fit with any of the categories specified in the help center.

Even if it is, &lt;strong&gt;that's not a reason for closure.&lt;/strong&gt; It would suggest, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt;, you haven't done your research, but I imagine you have.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it's hard to draw a rule of thumb on general questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;I propose a guideline&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a guideline we can use to determine whether general questions not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; related to a board or card game are appropriate for our site or not. A version of it has been used on &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Game Development&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpg.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Role-playing Games&lt;/a&gt; for years, and it's produced &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It'd be something like this for us:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Questions about a general topic, such as terminology, might more likely belong on another Stack Exchange site (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://english.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;) than here. A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself …&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;Would a board or card game expert give me a better/different/more specific answer to this question than a Linguist, Video game developer, etc?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If yes, then feel free to ask it here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For Game Development, where this guideline first originated, the major problem was non-game related programming questions, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;their FAQ&lt;/a&gt; specifically mentions it in that context. They now can recognise when a question isn't suitable for their site in that area and others (art, animation, mathematics, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For RPG.SE, &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.rpg.stackexchange.com/q/1604/1204&quot;&gt;our problem was real world topics&lt;/a&gt; - people developing a campaign would ask historical or geographical questions, or how fast certain boats were in real life. It was hard to tell what to do with those questions, since while many were totally appropriate, others weren't, and it was hard to know where to draw the line. It was a real problem for us and it took a couple of years before we found and adopted that guideline (heck, the meta question I linked was 'part two' - &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.rpg.stackexchange.com/q/570/1204&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; was two years prior). RPG players usually aren't the right people to ask about that stuff. &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpg.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;Our FAQ&lt;/a&gt; calls those out explicitly, and it's worked really well and finally made it clear which ones we should keep or close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For us, here on Board Games, the current issue is just a terminology question. There might be other stuff more appropriately mentioned here. I'm not sure if this has come up a lot for us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;So by this rule of thumb, is your terminology question on topic?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Whether you ask it on here, or on English as a term identification question, a basic answer will just be the name of the strategy (if it has a name). However, you'll get a more specific response on Board Games: someone spirited enough to do so may elaborate on why this isn't &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; advantageous in games, or may sometimes leave you worse off, or so on, elaborating on certain situations offered by certain games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So whilst it's &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; borderline, it's borderline on the side of yes, it's fine here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5573" LastEditorUserId="5573" LastEditDate="2014-06-25T22:56:16.017" LastActivityDate="2014-06-25T22:56:16.017" CommentCount="0" />

Within this broad field, a number of fairly distict subtopics may be recognized, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combinatorial game theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which studies sequential games of perfect information, such as Chess, Go or Tic-Tac-Toe.  These games are characterized by the property that they include no randomness or hidden information, and thus by the fact that, if all the players follow a perfectly optimal strategy (which must exist, in theory, even if it is not known), the outcome will always be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Classical&quot; game theory&lt;/strong&gt;, which assumes that all players are fully aware of each others' possible strategies and payoffs, but not necessarily of the specific moves others have chosen to make, and that they all choose their strategy independently to maximize their expected payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperative game theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which allows players to collude and form (more or less) binding coalitions through some kind of enforcement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolutionary game theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which replaces the assumption that players rationally choose their strategies with the assumption that they each follow a fixed hereditary strategy which they pass on, possibly with small mutations, to their offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point to note here is that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; these subfields, and many more besides, fall under the broad umbrella term &quot;game theory&quot;.  In fact, pretty much &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; mathematical (or quasi-mathematical) analysis of games could be considered a part of game theory, except maybe for games of pure luck (which are traditionally considered to fall under probability theory, although some might see this distinction as more of a historical artifact than an actual qualitative difference).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the questions mentioned above, as a mathematician I would regard them all as falling under the scope of game theory, even if some of the answers here may not possess quite the level of mathematical rigor I would usually expect of a formal game-theoretical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the following questions ask about optimal (or quasi-optimal) strategies of sequential games of perfect information, and are thus &lt;strong&gt;clearly within the scope of combinatorial game theory&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/6060/is-circus-maximus-solvable&quot;&gt;Is Circus Maximus solvable?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/7085/what-is-the-optimal-strategy-in-quantum-tic-tac-toe&quot;&gt;What is the optimal strategy in Quantum Tic Tac Toe?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/12477/is-ultimate-tic-tac-toe-solved&quot;&gt;Is Ultimate Tic Tac Toe solved?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/17863/hex-game-strategy&quot;&gt;Hex game strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/5470/what-are-the-main-results-in-game-theory-regarding-go&quot;&gt;What are the main results in game theory regarding Go?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The remaining two questions may not be about &lt;em&gt;combinatorial&lt;/em&gt; game theory, but do seem to fall under the scope of classical game theory:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/7375/maximum-attainable-points-for-a-single-player-in-a-two-player-game-of-carcassonn&quot;&gt;Maximum attainable points for a single player in a two player game of Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt; might or might not be a combinatorial question (I'm not sure if the stated assumptions are enough to eliminate all the randomness and uncertainty from the game), but if not, is surely is within the scope of classical game theory.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/17957/whats-the-name-of-the-theory-that-the-player-with-the-most-options-has-the-adva&quot;&gt;What&amp;#39;s the name of the theory that the player with the most options has the advantage?&lt;/a&gt;, while somewhat confusingly written, essentially presents a claim about optimal strategies (namely, that expanding the strategy space for a player cannot reduce the value of the game for said player) and asks whether this claim is a known game-theoretical theorem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; problems with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/game-theory&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;game-theory&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;game-theory&lt;/a&gt; tag here, IMO, are two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;several of the questions are simply not very good questions, or, even if the questions might be &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; interesting, are poorly asked; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;even the game-theory questions that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; reasonably well asked seem to rarely get good answers on this site, presumably because we don't have many mathematicians (or people from related fields) here to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I suspect that several of these questions would've been better asked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;math.SE&lt;/a&gt;, or possibly at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net&quot;&gt;MathOverflow&lt;/a&gt;.  That said, I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; also imagine valid game-theory questions that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; get better answers here (e.g. because they required extensive knowledge of a particular board or card game that most mathematicians would be unlikely to have), so I'm not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; ready to say that the tag simply shouldn't exist here.  But it is, IMO, sort of borderline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to summarize, I don't think there's anything wrong with the use of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/game-theory&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;game-theory&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;game-theory&lt;/a&gt; tag on these questions.

For example, I think it's OK to change my question &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/13490/how-does-kessig-cagebreakers-interact-with-gideon-jura&quot;&gt;How does Kessig Cagebreakers interact with Gideon Jura?&lt;/a&gt; to have the title&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If creatures enter the battlefield attacking, do they have to attack Gideon Jura?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;but not the title&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If creatures enter the battlefield attacking, and an ability has constrained what my creatures can attack, do the new creatures have to follow that constraint?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because while the second title is more general, it's not enough to justify the increase in length and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, I think we should avoid over-generalizing. In other words, we should make sure to avoid editing the title to be more general than the actual question. For example, we wouldn't edit &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/18149/6692&quot;&gt;shapesharer and stoneforge mystic&lt;/a&gt; to say&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do copies of creatures trigger enter-the-battlefield abilities?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the question is specifically about turning a creature already on the battlefield into a copy, and that changes the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2537" LastActivityDate="2014-07-10T03:30:46.623" CommentCount="17" />

Certainly!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a question title consists of merely &quot;Card vs Card&quot; or &quot;Card and Card&quot; or so on, I'll edit the title to try to capture the interaction between those cards so as to communicate what the heck is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it'll be contested that either of these retitles is better, because the &quot;vs&quot; says almost nothing about the situation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aegis of the Gods Vs.

No.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, here's the thing. Magic has a lot of cards, and a limited quantity of mechanics. Each new card combines those mechanics in new and different ways. Two cards using the same five mechanical concepts could put them in a different order and adjust the numbers and wind up not resembling each other at all. On top of that, the combination of any two remarkable cards is often incredibly unique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do end up revisiting the same mechanics over and over in Magic the Gathering answers, but that's because they keep getting re-used. That doesn't mean one answer explaining those five mechanics can necessarily answer a question about the other card.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For an example, consider the common mechanic of creatures with a P/T of &lt;code&gt;*/*&lt;/code&gt;, where that's defined by cards in graveyards. How many cards do that? &lt;a href=&quot;http://magiccards.info/query?q=o%3Apower+o%3Atoughness+o%3A%22equal+to%22+o%3Acards+o%3Ain+o%3Agraveyard&amp;amp;v=card&amp;amp;s=cname&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Not many more than 20&lt;/a&gt;, and most of them are subtly different to the rest in some way that's going to be &lt;em&gt;critical&lt;/em&gt; to a question. And look! &lt;a class=&quot;mtg-autocard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wizards.com/magic/autocard.asp?name=Nighthowler&quot;&gt;Nighthowler&lt;/a&gt; isn't even in that search, because it's subtly different in yet another way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, even if I replace a card name in a title with a description of that relevant mechanic, usually the question will still be uniquely about just one card. If a new question arrives about a card with similar mechanics, it often &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt; be a full duplicate of the previous one, even if we might go into detail on the same mechanics again. Generalising the title doesn't necessarily make it a good dupe candidate, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Generalising is often gainless&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could ask a question titled &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about {thing} when I have Etherium Sculptor out?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, or I could title it more generally with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about {thing} when I have a creature out that makes artifacts cost 1 less?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, except there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://magiccards.info/query?q=o%3Aartifact+o%3Aspells+o%3Acost+o%3Aless+o%3Acast&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;very few cards like that&lt;/a&gt; and Etherium Sculptor is one of them. We're not likely to get duplicates on this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we could rename &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/13805/does-progenitor-mimic-create-copies-of-itself-even-when-it-isnt-a-creature&quot;&gt;Does Progenitor Mimic create copies of itself even when it isn&amp;#39;t a creature?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to be more general. But what general title could we have? Something like: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can a creature which clones a creature then keeps creating copies of itself and refers to itself as a 'creature' in the description keep copying itself when it isn't a creature?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; That's sure more general, but there's still only one card this would even relate to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a recent concrete example, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/18269/what-happens-when-a-creature-with-whenever-a-creature-dies-dies-simultaneously&quot;&gt;What happens when a creature with &amp;quot;Whenever a creature dies&amp;quot; dies simultaneously with multiple other creatures?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was recently retitled from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does Marchesa, the Black Rose protect herself as well as others from board wipes that would kill her too?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Sure, we're revisiting the same mechanic again, and we're going to revisit them again another time, but this isn't actually likely to be a duplicate target because of the specific situation being asked about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Let's just generalise where the generalisation is absolutely helpful.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, this is overdoing it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I think that the community needs to be more aggressive about editing the titles of questions that contain almost purely card names unless they are absolutely unable to be generalized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this might be more helpful:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;... if the situation and mechanic are extremely general and can be safely &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; generalised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like here!

The current policy as stated in the help center and close reason does not make an exception, and there's not enough reason to change that policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, we will generally be able to provide good answers. Even if the questions are specific to the computer game, we are likely to have users who play it. In fact, we may even be a better place than Arqade: the leap from playing a board game to playing the computer version is not large, while not all PC/console gamers are going to end up playing computerized board games. Indeed, historically we've done pretty well with these kinds of questions, from the examples I was able to find.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also just confusing for some questions about a computerized board game to be okay, and some not. It's not great for us to define our scope in such a way that it's easy for users to make the wrong choice, or worse, easy for us to end up debating whether a question is specific to the computer version or not. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/18833/why-did-experiment-one-not-get-a-counter-when-my-undying-creature-returned-to-pl&quot;&gt;a recent MTG rules question&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be an MTGO bug - it turns out it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; specific to the computer version, but this is still definitely a great place to ask it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, at this point there just aren't enough of these questions to worry about. Arqade has all of two questions tagged [mtg-online], and though we don't have a separate tag, with a little searching I only found maybe 6 MTGO questions. There are other computerized board game questions out there, but I don't think they're too numerous either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I don't think it's worth making an explicit change to our policy: it's a fairly reasonable policy, and it's not causing any problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="409" LastEditorUserId="409" LastEditDate="2014-09-15T23:29:13.080" LastActivityDate="2014-09-15T23:29:13.080" CommentCount="14" />

The reasons were several, and mostly correctly guessed by others:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don't like deleting comments during the active phase of a Q/A. I personally find it weird and disturbing to come back and find my comments gone. And I take pride in my good comments, and like to occasionally check them out and see if they got voted up. An alternative, also valid point of view is that cleaning up comments keeps the site clean and focussed on the essentials. From a moderation perspective, I take the same position as Pat - I remove old comments that are no longer necessary, but I give them a grace period. Since &lt;em&gt;I personally&lt;/em&gt; don't see a lot of value in comment removal, I don't put a lot of effort into it, but if I see them, and they're uncontroversial, I remove them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When the content of the comments has been fully incorporated into an answer, or an issue has been unambiguously resolved to the satisfaction of all parties, then I tend to delete them immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Removing comments sometimes upsets the commenter. It then takes more time to explain why the comment was removed, and deal with the upset. So if the situation is relatively neutral, I err on the side of retaining comments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Comment flags are prolific, and they aren't all that important in the greater scheme of things. I'm sympathetic to &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251175/stack-overflow-is-not-yet-a-vast-wasteland-a-history-of-moderator-tooling/251176#251176&quot;&gt;the discussion here&lt;/a&gt;. The main points are 1) there are a lot of comment flags, 2) they take a surprising amount of work to resolve correctly, 3) they aren't a huge value add.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it's not easy to tell whether a comment is truly obsolete. Although I am a Magic player, I don't play with modern cards. It's significant effort to prove the flag, and in my opinion, value judgements like this quickly enter a murky world where moderation can overstep its authority. See for example my discussion of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/167624/can-we-have-an-unambiguous-official-ruling-on-what-the-not-an-answer-flag-is&quot;&gt;not an answer flag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Accepting/declining is a way of giving feedback to you, the flag raiser. By declining, I am suggesting this flag was not worth raising. In my opinion, although there is nothing technically &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with these flags, they are not worth the time for you to raise, and for me to understand, arbitrate and manage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastActivityDate="2014-09-25T00:10:23.750" CommentCount="1" />

I scanned the various first half dozen or so posts on why game recommendation threads in general were bad for here and what to do instead.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question relates to the following:   If you have a question of the sort &quot;I'm looking for a game with features X,Y, and Z&quot;,  I've already seen plenty of explanations as to why that's unacceptable and suggestions for the alternative, such as board game geek's search site.   However,  using that site I did not see the specific game mechanics I was looking for, which I didn't think was &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; obscure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So,  with the preamble out of the way,  would a question of the following format be acceptable:   &quot;How would one go about searching for a game with the following criterea?&quot;  That &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like it avoids the pitfalls that are wanted to avoided.

At its core, it's asking for a general summary of Magic's turn structure, specifically in visual form. Without the restriction to visual form, it would be a good question (a nice general reference thing we can point people to, even), and with the restriction it only becomes more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The major arguments that have been raised are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's subjective&lt;/strong&gt;, since it's asking for &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; diagrams, and that's a subjective decision. This is an unconvincing argument since it's really not unusually subjective. All questions are implicitly asking for the best possible explanation, and we routinely use voting to sort out which one we collectively think is best. Further, the question actually provides some specific criteria for evaluation, making it even less subjective. The comments on the existing answer indeed suggest that there's some rough agreement about what would make a good answer, not people just subjectively arguing about the best possible diagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a list question&lt;/strong&gt;, asking for a list of diagrams. This is an unconvincing argument because this really isn't the sort of fatally flawed question that label is meant for. It's simply asking for a diagram or set of diagrams which fully explain things, similar to the way a question asking for the explanation in text form would be asking for a set of paragraphs - that's not really a list. A list question, the kind we hate, is a poll, something that won't really be complete until there's a long list - like &quot;what are the cards that combo with X?&quot; Per &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/124489/133299&quot;&gt;this meta answer&lt;/a&gt;, a short way to describe list questions is &quot;answers that have value only in aggregate&quot;, or from the help center, every answer is equally valid, or you expect more answers like your own, or there's no actual problem to be solved. That doesn't really apply here - the problem to be solved is explaining the turn structure in a clear, concise way, and while there's room for multiple answers, there's no way every possible diagram would be equally good. (Remember, every question has the issue that people can post near-duplicate answers, which will then be equally good - that doesn't make them list questions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple more arguments surfaced in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can't prove anything about what the question invites.&lt;/strong&gt; This argument is plainly absurd. If you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/help/closed-questions&quot;&gt;in the help center about closing questions&lt;/a&gt;, for example how we decide if they're too broad, it explicitly mentions things about what kinds of answers the question is asking for. This is true all over the place anywhere in the help and on meta.stackexchange.com when people discuss these things. This is a key part of how we judge questions. So no, we can't &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; it, but we can discuss it and make sane decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We shouldn't discuss this on meta.&lt;/strong&gt; Again, completely absurd. If you want to discuss whether question closure is a good topic for meta, start another meta question about it, I guess, but this is what the meta.stackexchange.com FAQ say to do if you think a question has been closed in error (doing it when it's only halfway there is pretty much equivalent) and people have been doing it across the stackexchange network for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="409" LastEditorUserId="409" LastEditDate="2014-11-26T16:38:28.043" LastActivityDate="2014-11-26T16:38:28.043" CommentCount="13" />

If we have tags for some keyword abilities but not others, and for some ability words but not others, and that choice is made based on site activity, it makes this problem much worse. If a new user asks a question, they would have to attempt to tag it with every ability the question is actually about to properly tag the question. As question volume grows, this could even make it difficult for experienced editors, who would have to know every keyword that has a tag to recognize when a question is missing one. In addition, a question that asks about the interaction between five different keyword abilities (I'm sure it's possible) would be impossible to tag correctly if all those abilities have tags. All of these are parts of the same problem: in the context of search, a tag should allow someone to find all questions about that topic; with these sorts of tags, that may be difficult or even impossible to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2537" LastEditorUserId="2537" LastEditDate="2014-12-03T01:46:46.427" LastActivityDate="2014-12-03T01:46:46.427" CommentCount="3" />

However, &lt;strong&gt;this is fine:&lt;/strong&gt; the tags still provide excellent categorisation value, and we find them very helpful, and the fact we might never answer a question with &lt;em&gt;that tag alone&lt;/em&gt; doesn't really cause any trouble.

The alternative would be to actually prove that no rule allows it. Proving that no relevant rule exists would be like attempting to prove that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Russell's teapot&lt;/a&gt; does not exist, but on a smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the commenters believed that shifting the burden of proof to the asker was equivalent to not addressing the question at all.

However, FAQs are simply a collection of questions that are frequently asked. The FAQ didn't even mention why the answer was correct.

  <row Id="1251" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1249" CreationDate="2015-01-14T18:09:31.833" Score="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;The primary flaw in your premise is that you seem to assume that a game rulebook is primarily a list of things that players are allowed to do, which implies that demonstrating that a player is not allowed to do something can require enumerating the rules. However, rule books are primarily definitional. If we look at the Magic: the Gathering rulebook (which I have the experience), the first &lt;strong&gt;five&lt;/strong&gt; major headings define the parts of the game. The first one defines the fundamental concepts, and the next four give more detailed definitions for some of those concepts. Because these rules are definitions, they enumerate what relevant actions a player can take, and the player cannot take other actions &lt;strong&gt;by definition&lt;/strong&gt;. If someone asks &quot;Can I do X when I have priority?&quot; the response is &quot;Rule 116 defines priority. You can only do the things it lists.&quot; If they ask &quot;Can I choose purple as a color for some effect?&quot; you don't need to scour the rulebook to find a rule that allows it, you just need to quote the definition of color in rule 105.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of issues here. First, the fact that your question was downvoted. For that, we have to consider the revision history, since people were voting before you edited to your current version. If we look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/revisions/21119/1&quot;&gt;original version&lt;/a&gt; of your answer, you had this &quot;proof by contradiction&quot; that had these assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;You have 10 points.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The game has not ended yet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;You win when you have 10 points. &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;This assumption is taken directly from the rules.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The game ends when a player wins. &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;This assumption is taken directly from the rules.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem I see here is that according to the arguments you used, the rules quoted in points 3 and 4 (or even just point 3) are sufficient to conclude that if a player has 10 points, then the game is over. In other words, your argument is logically equivalent to &quot;&quot;According to [rule from point 3] and [rule from point 4], the game ends when any player has 10 points.&quot; Unless I am missing something major, that conclusion is also the conclusion of your answer. Everything besides those two rules is unnecessary to the argument and just makes it more convoluted. The strategy of using &quot;proof by contradiction&quot; was completely unnecessary and made the logic harder to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just want to make this clear: the argument you originally gave was bad because it had an unnecessary step (contradicting a made-up premise) and, for the conclusion you seemed to be &quot;proving&quot;, two or three unnecessary premises.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second issue is the more general one of people asking for rulings that may not exist. The fact that I mostly answer MTG questions probably biases my view of this, but in my experience the rules don't just allow you to do some things or disallow you from doing some things; they specify &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; what players can do. The point is that every situation should have a definitive ruling from the rules, and as I said in my previous paragraph, that seems to be the case for this question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a final note about FAQs: rules in games are not like rules in math or science, which must be discovered and/or proven. They are true &lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt; they are the rules of the game. Any official rulings therefore come from the highest possible authority and are therefore as true as the rules themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2537" LastEditorUserId="2537" LastEditDate="2015-01-14T20:41:34.930" LastActivityDate="2015-01-14T20:41:34.930" CommentCount="25" />

I know the longer argument has been removed, but I'm not sure whether you got your downvotes on this form or the old one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that it's not necessarily logic that's being treated harshly here. It does also matter how you say things. Although I'm sure you didn't mean it this way, your answer in its final form might come across to some people as being a bit derisive: it sounds like you're saying to the OP, &quot;you're just making up rules&quot;. Perhaps you could present your proof without saying &quot;made up rules&quot; - for example, you could say &quot;there is nothing in the rules about having to announce your score.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I think that you haven't necessarily presented the argument itself in the most convincing way. You've just asserted that this isn't in the rules. You've left it as an exercise to the reader to go through the rules and make sure that the rules really don't say anything about this. You could instead just quote the most relevant passage of the rules:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you have 10 or more victory points during your turn&#xA;  the game ends and you are the winner! If you reach 10 points&#xA;  when it is not your turn, the game continues until any player&#xA;  (including you) has 10 points on his turn. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and then point out that it doesn't say anything about revealing, simply that you must &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; the rules. You could also consider quoting the section about Victory Point Cards, though admittedly it says &quot;You &lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt; only reveal them...to win the game&quot; and is not really clear that you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, it doesn't make as much sense to readers if you instead present a logical argument about made-up rules that appears very isolated from the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the original form of the answer, I think that your attempt at a logical proof unfortunately was unnecessary and confused the point. Keep in mind, the OP's question boils down to &quot;I know I win at 10 points. Is that 10 points including things that are in my secret hand, or do I not actually have those points until I show them to people?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your answer's original phrasing, you used as one of your assumptions &quot;You have ten points&quot;, and interpreted the rules to say that you have the points whether or not you've revealed them. (&quot;Assumption 1 is simply true. You have 10 points. This is an observable fact.&quot;) That interpretation is the core answer to the OP's question. Once you make that point, you don't really need to prove that it results in winning and ending the game; everyone was fully aware that the game ends when someone reaches 10 points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a side note, there was no need to formulate the proof as a proof by contradiction. You danced around it, but you essentially said that assumption 1 (you have ten points) plus assumption 3 (if you have ten points you win) plus assumption 4 (the game ends when someone wins) implies that the game has ended (assumption 2).

The full version of the criteria it mentioned for board/card/dice/tabletop games on topic here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be playable on or around a table&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have objective rules of play and win conditions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Offer dynamic challenges, either through other players, randomization, or both&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be playable by hand, by human players implementing all of the rules&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A game must meet &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these in order to be on topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sports betting and horse gambling most certainly do not meet these criteria.

I don't think it sounds like a terribly &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; game - you're not making really meaningful decisions - but the criteria don't require that.

My issue is: it is the worst of the three at being a canon question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a canon question on a topic is be really clear and simple. It should be focused on that one topic as much as possible, with minimum excess, so as to not reduce clarity at all. That way, people will search for it, find it, and &lt;em&gt;understand it,&lt;/em&gt; and not ask a new question &amp;mdash; nor find themselves S.O.L. when we close their new question as a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Marchesa question is the &lt;em&gt;most complex and unsuitable&lt;/em&gt; of these three! The question is the longest, and there are more mechanical &lt;em&gt;bits&lt;/em&gt; involved in this particular situation (resurrection, counters, a condition on the trigger) than the other two questions (you get cards/spirits).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both of the other two are short and simple by comparison.

The newest question. The newest question is the simplest expression of the question we have so far, and the others add some complexity that distracts from the actual answer. However, I see a few minor problems that I think we should consider, but that are not necessarily sufficient to not do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the easiest issue to solve. If we want to implement this, we need 5 votes to open each of the two closed questions, and 5 more votes to close the 2 older questions as duplicates. I think doing it half-way will end up worse than leaving it in the current state. We don't want to have two of the questions open, or all of them closed &lt;em&gt;(Further experimentation indicates that this is impossible)&lt;/em&gt;, or a chain of duplicates. Each of those provides a worse user experience than what we currently have. Basically, we should try to make sure we put the votes together before we start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Asker experience&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When someone asks a question and it gets closed, it often feels like a punishment or reprimand. And in some sense, that's accurate. Closing as &quot;off-topic&quot; or &quot;too opinion based&quot; means that they should have read the FAQ. Closing as a duplicate means that they should have searched before asking. Usually users take the message more harshly than we mean it, but the meaning is generally still there. That is why I am hesitant to close a question that followed all the rules and was not a duplicate when it was asked. Surprises, and especially negative ones, are a bad user experience. I'm not saying that this is a deal breaker, just that it's something to consider. &lt;em&gt;(EDIT: Apparently the person who asked the question is explicitly OK with this decision)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Policy implications&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we do this, it raises the question of whether we should generally close old, detailed questions if someone asks a new, more canonical question about essentially the same thing. As I said in my second paragraph, this takes a concerted effort, and would probably often require at least reopening the new question and closing the old one, so it would make sense to have a plan so that users generally know when it should be done. Sometimes it would just be unwieldy; if the old question has 10 duplicates pointing to it, changing all of them may be too much of a pain to bother with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What if a new question is asked that is an &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; better canonical question. Do we change all of the dupe targets again? How much better should it be to make that change? &lt;em&gt;(EDIT: It seems that this question &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/1223/6692&quot;&gt;has already been brought up on this meta&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2537" LastEditorUserId="2537" LastEditDate="2015-01-28T20:51:26.473" LastActivityDate="2015-01-28T20:51:26.473" CommentCount="3" />

After some digging, I found that the game in question, Citadels, is published by three different companies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For Citadels, I have three distinct contracts. Hans im Glueck has the publishing rights in German, Dutch and Czech, Millenium in French and Spanish. Fantasy Flight Games originally published the game in English and in the Scandinavian languages, but we regularly add other languages to the list.&#xA;  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://faidutti.com/blog/?cat=31&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It turns out these publishers hold distinctly different interpretations of the game's rules. Some examples include,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fantasy Flight Games&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(The queen) receives three gold if you are sitting next to the King (or the Emperor).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(The warlord) may not, however, destroy a district in a city that is already completed by having eight districts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You may not build a district such that you have two identical districts (two “Castle” cards, two “Market” cards, etc.) in your city.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hans im Glueck (999 Games)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The queen receives three gold at the start of her turn if she sits next to the player with the wooden king.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The warlord may not destroy districts from cities that already has eight districts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(no equivalent rule found)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first two examples are rules with contradictory interpretations.

Total overlap is really bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Poker has total overlap with Board and Card Games. Not a single question about Poker would be off topic here. Also, looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3425/poker&quot;&gt;their Area 51 stats&lt;/a&gt;, Poker has been in beta for three years and is only hitting 1.5 questions per day. Given the total overlap and the poor question rate, I think Poker would be better served by merging with Board and Card Games. Poker is a card game. This site is called Board and &lt;em&gt;Card&lt;/em&gt; Games. Makes sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to Casino Gaming and Gambling: the games and the gambling. Gambling is off topic here. Therefore, if they can get the traffic, they have a good reason to exist separately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6692" LastActivityDate="2015-03-19T14:45:23.317" CommentCount="0" />

As for you proposals:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not opposed to merging Poker into here, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.poker.stackexchange.com/questions/134/is-poker-a-site-we-should-keep-around/136#136&quot;&gt;they are&lt;/a&gt; so until they change their mind it is a rather moot point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a bad idea. For one in addition to not wanting to be combined with us Poker doesn't want to be combined with Gambling or Casino Games either, since while their game does regularly take place in a casino it involves more skill than luck and you aren't playing against the house. Also while Poker and some other card games like Blackjack make some sense being combined with Casino Games and Gambling there are plenty other like Dominion and other deck building games, and Magic and other TCG/CCG games that are harder to justify combining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here we have a clearly definied scope for our questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be playable on or around a table &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have objective rules of play and win&#xA;conditions &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Offer dynamic challenges, either through other players,&#xA;randomization, or both &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be playable by hand, by human players&#xA;implementing all of the rules&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Poker clearly falls into all of those categories, which is why I'm not opposed to them merging into here, however not all &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/1248/are-casino-games-on-topic-here?lq=1&quot;&gt;casino games&lt;/a&gt; fall under that criteria, and gambling is not on topic here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Rainbolt says it seems like you are trying to avoid overlap, and I think having some overlap isn't a bad thing. Poker questions can still be asked here, and they generally get answered (the only on that hasn't was more about probability that poker anyway), if someone comes here with a poker question that is off topic we can always migrate the question to the Poker SE. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gambling however is a completely separate topic from what we cover here, as such I do not support merging that proposal with us or expanding our scope to include it.

If one group has figured out a trick to get more use from a card they will likely value it higher then a group that hasn't.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Personal play style and deck construction. This plays a lot into the value of a card. If a card fits into the overall style and construction of your deck you are going to place more value on it then if it doesn't. Which means that if Card A fits into your deck better then card B it doesn't matter that others think more highly of Card B.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Expansions, while I know that answers will get out of date when expansions and rules change the simple fact that a cards value can change drastically with each expansion.

Often this will include comments they disagree with (and ones they agree with), and that's fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the recurring tasks for moderators is the need to clean up a huge chaotic discussion and leave behind a single conclusion. That is, moderators at some point have to make a decision and act; it can't always be discussed to death/consensus, especially not outside of meta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are of course gray areas sometimes. When the conclusion isn't entirely clear, moderators still have to pick one, at least for now. It can be further discussed later on meta, and decisions can be changed, but there's not always the luxury of leaving things there, starting a meta thread, waiting for a conclusion, and then going back - by that time you've left a mess in place for days. And it's also not moderators' job to start a meta post for every disagreement in which they're forced to intervene; that's something the rest of us can do too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I think broadly the right thing happened here: the comments disappeared, a possibly reasonable conclusion was posted, and there's even a &quot;discuss further on meta&quot; comment. We can debate about whether the conclusion was the right one in this case (in yet another meta question!) if we like, but I'm not too worried about what happened here. The absolute worst case is a moderator made an error in judgment about an honestly not that critical issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sole issue I see here is that there's no short &quot;here's roughly what was deleted and/or why&quot; comment. I do think those are often a good idea, and would've helped a bit in these cases. That said, I don't think we should assume bad faith on the part of moderators: if they delete a discussion that we're all fully aware was too large (should've been on meta) and possibly less civil than ideal, and leave some sort of summary comment and a suggestion to discuss on meta, we can all read between the lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment&quot;&gt;comments are temporary &quot;post-it&quot; notes&lt;/a&gt;. If we want a discussion to stay on the site permanently, we should move it to meta as soon as it becomes clear it won't be a simple, short back-and-forth. If we instead have a giant meta discussion in comments, we shouldn't be surprised if it gets wiped away, regardless of whether we happen to share the opinion of the moderator who leaves behind a &quot;here's the deal for now&quot; comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="409" LastEditorUserId="409" LastEditDate="2015-03-26T19:35:16.347" LastActivityDate="2015-03-26T19:35:16.347" CommentCount="9" />

I wish things hadn't escalated quite as much, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I understand right, posting a question here instead of continuing in the comments there might have resulted in a completely different outcome. In this case, it seems there's a conflict between &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/25209/133299&quot;&gt;then-meta.SO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.boardgames.stackexchange.com/q/647/409&quot;&gt;meta.B&amp;amp;CG&lt;/a&gt;, and the general once-answer-per-user precedent here, which played out as a conflict between Pat (and some others) and you (and some others).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, as the disagreement in the comments showed, we have something to discuss, and I can understand a moderator being exasperated when we refuse to use the tools given us for having that discussion. So unfortunately, I think we pretty much backed Pat into a corner. By discussing only in comments, we were basically declining to have a real discussion, at which point I think he was within his rights to act based on his own views.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, I do think this would've all been simpler if we'd come to meta sooner like Pat asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Should you have had two separate answers to this question?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: meh, I don't really think so, but if you want to, it's acceptable, no rule against it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A sentiment I've seen a few times: if the question needs multiple answers, it might not be a good question. There's certainly some truth to that here: the question aimed for a yes or no answer, but it's not really a yes or no question. Slow play is always going to have gray areas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that spirit, I think it would've been possible to avoid the whole issue by writing an &quot;it depends, sometimes yes sometimes no&quot; answer. You'd still be able to make the same points, and I think it would be a better, more complete answer than either one of them on its own. You'd convey something more fully thought out, rather than the split answers which have trouble coming to any real conclusion. You'd avoid people rebutting one answer with things you said in the other. Bottom line, you could make your point about the question not having a single clear answer directly! Seems win-win to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, that's all stuff about how I think you could best write your answer, and that's not really up to me. There's a way in which you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; write answers to the question such that they become mutually exclusive and thus should be separate answers. If you want to present it that way, I suppose it's okay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Is it worth moderator enforcement (answer deletion)?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do think it would have been better to write just a single answer. But is it a big enough deal for a moderator to step in? I waffled a lot about this. My first preference would of course be to come to consensus and avoid the whole issue (via a meta discussion on meta).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Failing that, I think I lean toward no. If you want to provide two answers even though it might be less helpful, that's your choice, and I can always downvote if I think they're unhelpful. As mentioned above, there's no actual rule against it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, if this kind of thing became a pattern, I would lean more toward enforcement; if we have people systematically presenting their answers in less helpful ways, trying to artificially chop them up into distinct pieces, that's probably not great for the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="409" LastEditorUserId="409" LastEditDate="2015-03-26T21:52:09.457" LastActivityDate="2015-03-26T21:52:09.457" CommentCount="4" />

I'll give the better answer below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;@murgatroid99 - SE is not a platform for polls. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;admitted&lt;/em&gt; you set up a poll in a comment.  You also stated that you probably covered all possible answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The question reads as subjective to me. I thought it had the potential to be good subjective, which is why I did not downvote it or vote to close. Instead, I presented the two answers that I expect this question to get (approximately), with the expectation that votes would indicate consensus about which answer is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Posting multiple answers can be valid, but should be rare. Attempting to cover the whole answer space by posting diametrically opposed answers does not help.  You cannot believe that both answers are true.  I didn't read everything in all threads you linked to but I didn't see any indication of support for answers that the poster does not believe in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difference between multiple answers and &quot;a poll&quot; is where we might differ.  To me, someone posting different answers is proposing two different answers to a problem.  They believe in each one, but do not know which is best so they offer both to the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to see the answerer willing to own both answers, curating them as new information flows in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This you did not do&lt;/strong&gt;.  (From another comment)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I don't have an answer to that. I was trying to present the argument as I understood it. I don't know enough to improve this answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intent is everything.  I believe your intent was to set up a poll and not provide different yet simultaneously correct answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think your actual thoughts on the question were contained with a comment on the main question.  (Don't put your answers in comments!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Since it's not explicitly mentioned in the tournament rules, it most likely varies from one judge to another. The situations you mention support that hypothesis: some judges say that the would rule it as slow play, while others clearly don't. I'm not really sure what you're expecting here besides one answer with &quot;yes, it is slow play&quot; and explanation, and another with &quot;no, it is not slow play&quot; and explanation. And you already seem to have provided both of those explanations. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that I've received a chance to put my thoughts down on this it seems that I did make a mistake.  You haven't stated clearly what the answer you most believe in is.  You've given three answers (including the comment).  I only deleted two and could lead to confusion or possibly signal which answer I prefer.  I've rectified that.  I encourage you to re-answer that question if you are able to clarify your own thoughts about what the correct answer should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why are polls bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure most are aware of this, but for completeness I wanted to answer this briefly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SE works because it connects people with questions to people with answers.  People are incented to answer in part because of reputation.  At the time I deleted the second answer there were a total of 5 upvotes and 6 downvotes to the two questions.  Prior to the deletion that resulted in +38 reputation.  This leads to a higher rep and the user being slightly more trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Repeat this a few dozen times and you begin to see the issue.  How many questions do we get that can be boiled down to &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; ?  How much reputation could be gained just by answering quickly and first regardless of the correctness of the answer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The race to be first is already strong enough.  The rewards are evident. But lets encourage each person to lead with their best answer and be rewarded thusly. Attempting to monopolize the whole answer space should not be rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believed what I did was in the best interests of the site and/or community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40" LastActivityDate="2015-03-26T22:38:04.550" CommentCount="6" />

However, reworked as &quot;How can I play games with both my seeing children and blind son?&quot; it becomes a question where more ideas could be shared, often with specific examples to back them up.

It also requires often substantial knowledge of how cards are templated, which is usually only gained through a lot of experience with the game. For example, taking the &lt;a href=&quot;http://boardgames.stackexchange.com/a/20474/6692&quot;&gt;second answer you linked&lt;/a&gt;, the two searches that found the given cards (on magiccards.info) are&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;o:&quot;mana as though&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;o:&quot;}, {T}: Add&quot; or (o:&quot;}: Add&quot; -o:&quot;{T}&quot;) (o:&quot;Add {W&quot; or o:&quot;Add {U&quot; or o:&quot;Add {B&quot; or o:&quot;Add {R&quot; or o:&quot;Add {G&quot; or o:&quot;Add one mana&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first search is the shortest string that matches both Sunglasses of Urza (which was mentioned in the question) and Mycosynth Lattice (which I remembered had a similar ability) without matching any irrelevant abilities.

I also think that, as long as the list isn't insanely long, it should be provided in the answer. The list is still helpful, even if the process is there. Also, if things are nontrivial, making it part of the answer provides an opportunity to annotate and explain things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the process is complex - for example if the best you could do was make five separate searches, weed out false positives, and combine the results - it might not always be terribly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In either case, I don't think there's really any reason to answer with &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; the process. Providing the list directly answers the question, generally desirable in answers. It also helps demonstrate that the process works, making it easier for readers/voters to see that you haven't overlooked something, which in turn makes it more likely for us to end up with a good, complete answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;StackOverflow is a decent analogy here. When someone has a specific programming problem, a good answer will include a specific solution for that problem. It might also include some broad discussion of how to arrive at that solution, and that'll often make it a much more valuable answer, but without the solution itself, it's not the best answer it could be.

It's interesting that you mention MLA citations, because Comprehensive Rules references can be very similar The name &quot;Comprehensive Rules&quot; is like an author/title combination in an MLA citation, and the specific section reference (like &quot;302.6&quot;) is like the page number reference in an MLA inline citation. Together, those are sufficient for anyone to find the quoted text themselves and verify it. And that, I think, is what's important: that anyone reading the answer can easily verify the quotation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I say that answer authors should not be &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; to give a link to the Comprehensive Rules, I also think that such a link is &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; detrimental to an answer, and that it would &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; be appropriate to edit such a link into the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that how much that applies to any other game depends on how discoverible that game's rules are online. The MTG comprehensive rules are easy to find with the obvious Google search. If a game's rules are difficult to find, then it would be more valuable to provide a link, so that verifying a quotation does not require an inordinate amount of work.

Linking to it is an additional helpful thing to do in many cases. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a link to a forum thread containing a response from the game designer is pretty much required.

I'd generally do it, because it's easy, and it might save someone the time of getting the rules out of the box to see.

It's similar to the &quot;nice, but optional&quot; case in the list above. True, the rules are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; available online, but that generally means that people already know how to find them, especially the kind of people actually interested in reading the comprehensive rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's incredibly rare that someone asks for a source; most people are happy to either read what's quoted in the answer or use Google to find more. If someone really can't figure it out, they can ask a question.

The more links there are, the less important it is that we bother adding them to more answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, sure, link if you like. It certainly doesn't hurt.

  <row Id="1350" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1347" CreationDate="2015-08-10T22:30:06.580" Score="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;I flagged an answer-comment once on Board and Card Games. It was deemed helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/lfIDI.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/lfIDI.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You raised the same type of flag, and it was rejected. That tells me that our moderators probably handle these types of flags differently. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but in this case I think our moderators need to be consistent. I expect answer-comment flags to be handled in a consistent manner, be it &quot;helpful&quot; or &quot;declined&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mentioned the Help page. There is another far more obvious sign that answer do not belong in comments. If you click on the &quot;add a comment&quot; anchor:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/p16FF.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/p16FF.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid answering questions in comments.&lt;/strong&gt; The text has been there since before I joined eighteen months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I asked about the extremely high quantity of answer-comments on English Language and Usage (ELU) Stack Exchange, and I was pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.english.stackexchange.com/a/2654/72792&quot;&gt;this meta post&lt;/a&gt;. I realized that ELU is unique in that a large portion of the questions have a multiple correct, extremely short answers. It makes sense for them to bounce ideas around in the comments. It makes sense for them to be less strict.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We primarily deal with questions that have a single correct answer. It makes sense for us to enforce stricter quality standards. Answers belong in the answer box, where the remainder of the community can mold it into something better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6692" LastActivityDate="2015-08-10T22:30:06.580" CommentCount="0" />
