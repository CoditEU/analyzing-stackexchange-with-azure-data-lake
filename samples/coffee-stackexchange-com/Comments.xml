  <row Id="1493" PostId="166" Score="0" Text="Yes, the means/variance change for each sample point if you are taking averages. But for those points the SD dropping just corresponds to a close agreement in quality reviews and a narrowing of the (gray) variance. When you say that most of the drop occurs within 14 days, that makes sense visually. If you say that the drop occurs within 1.5 SD of the origin, fine (I can't judge, it's your data). Then the SD is that of the overall distribution, which is fixed and does not drop." CreationDate="2015-08-10T19:38:51.693" UserId="1068" />
