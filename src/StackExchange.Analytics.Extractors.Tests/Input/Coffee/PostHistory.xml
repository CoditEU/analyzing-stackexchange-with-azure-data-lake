What the tamp does, is prime the coffee bed to be met with water. What we know about the water is that in general, in commercial machines, water is applied with 9 bars of pressure. Physics tells us that pressured water flow will take the path of least resistance. By this logic, the tamp functions by making the coffee bed smooth, even, and robust enough to be hit with 9 bars of pressure and extract evenly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Barista Health&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;*Note: In no way am I a qualified physician. This is not to be considered medical advice.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the surface one tamps on is on the proper level, the barista should be able to tamp with their elbo at a 90 degree(ish) angle, and their wrists in a semi-straight path to prevent damage. The barista can then use their body weight, and not muscle, to perform the tamp. By leaning into the tamp with the correct path, one can achieve about 30lbs of pressure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Experiments with varying pressure&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally I have experimented with varying pressured tamps and have found that applying a greater pressure than 30 lbs produced little effect, at most, a longer extraction. There are other variables that should be adjusted instead, such as the grind size, to achieve such an effect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xt7gz.jpg" />

The longer they sit, the less gasses will be left behind by the time they're used to brew.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So when a Third Wave coffee shop grinds using a doser, the Barista rapid-fires the dosing lever, essentially moving the coffee straight into the portafilter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A better plan is just to use a direct-dosing grinder where the grounds are metered by time or weight straight into the filter.

Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/" />

Some of these have to do with the concentration of various compounds in the coffee and the roasting process, but the way you brew the coffee can make a big difference as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that you are not going to be harvesting and roasting your own coffee, we can focus on the brewing process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Buying Beans:** Robusta vs Arabica&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To decrease perceived bitterness in coffee, the best choice is Arabica. Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Water**: Temperature and Chemistry&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Brewing [Extraction]**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**SCIENCE**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**More Information**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://bit.ly/1v0cTwR&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://bit.ly/1z7ZVvt&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Some of these have to do with the concentration of various compounds in the coffee and the roasting process, but the way you brew the coffee can make a big difference as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that you are not going to be harvesting and roasting your own coffee, we can focus on the brewing process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Buying Beans:** Robusta vs Arabica&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To decrease perceived bitterness in coffee, the best choice is Arabica. Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Water**: Temperature and Chemistry&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Brewing [Extraction]**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**SCIENCE**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**More Information**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

I've found that it is unsuitable or less than satisfactory for beans that aren't recommended for espresso brewing.  While the Aeropress allows less control over &quot;brew&quot; strength.  The V60 should be more flexible.  Varying the grind and pour speed should allow a level of control not present with an Aeropress.  " />

Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process.  Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process).   If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine.  If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine." />

If the water is exposed to the grounds for a very short amount of time (e.g., 10-15 seconds for espresso), you need a finer grind to provide enough surface area to extract the coffee from the beans. If the brewing time is long (e.g., the ~4 minutes of french press), you need a coarse grind to avoid over-extracting the grounds and getting something too bitter to drink.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's really the heart of it. If the grind is too coarse for your brewing method, your coffee will end up under-extracted, weak, and acidic. If it is too fine a grind, your coffee ends up over-extracted and bitter. Your grinder is a good brand; if you still have the manual, it includes a guide to grind vs. brewing method. If not, the capresso.com site includes PDF versions." />

While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as &quot;decaffeinated&quot;, they are better termed &quot;uncaffeinated&quot; because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Want to know even more?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Advanced ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Swiss Water process###&#xD;&#xA;The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; process###&#xD;&#xA;it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sourced from https://en.wikipedia.org&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is not my opinion although I don't have decaf, but just something I picked up on the net:&#xD;&#xA;![I don't know?!][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/j5w3t.jpg" />

Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.&#xD;&#xA;- Arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.&#xD;&#xA;- From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.&#xD;&#xA;- Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. *It is said to help improve* the **crema**. &#xD;&#xA;One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available. Rather, Robusta is usually used as a filler or cost reducer. &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;- Robusta beans are much more circular, whereas Arabica are more oval.&#xD;&#xA;- Chlorogenic acid is a significant antioxidant and an insect deterrent. Robusta is 7-10% CGA and Arabica has 5.5-8% CGA.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sourced from http://theroasterspack.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/MzlPd.png" />

Coffee enthusiasts &amp; aficionados identify acidity as the dry, bright &amp; sparkling sensation that sets a high-quality, high-grown coffee apart from a mundane, lower-grown coffee.

On the scientific side, acidity is something to be measured on the pH scale, which uses 7.0 as an indicator of neutrality, numbers under 7 as more acidic &amp; numbers above 7 as lower-acid (or basic). Lemon juice registers at about 2.0; milk at 6.5. A typical higher-acid breakfast blend coffee might land somewhere around 4.7.

After roasting, they continue to be affected by environmental factors, their own natural instability, and interaction with other compounds. The most important of these processes are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Dissipation into other media. Aromatics evaporate from the surface of the coffee into the atmosphere or are dissolved into solvents, where they often interact with other chemicals.&#xD;&#xA;- Non-enzymatic browning reactions. These involve carbohydrates, usually sugars, in carmelization and Maillard reactions. Carmelization occurs when a sugar gives up water and carbon dioxide, changing the structure of the sugar and its taste. The Maillard reaction is the result of an interaction between amino acids and carbohydrates in which an aromatically perceived substance is formed. When the Maillard reaction takes place at a high temperature (as in coffee roasting), the result is usually desirable roasted flavors and aromas, but when it takes place at a lower temperature, the result is flat, gluey, and cardboard-like flavors.&#xD;&#xA;- Oxidation. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different compounds. In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived) compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The engine that drives all of these processes forward is thermal energy (heat).

The absence of the milk fats means that the foam will not &quot;coagulate&quot; as easily. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The proteins chains in milk are polar: one end of the chain is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hydrophilic (attracted to water), and the other is hydrophobic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (repelled by water). Because milk is mostly made up of water, as soon&#xD;&#xA;&gt; as those proteins unfold, exposing their ends, the hydrophobic ends&#xD;&#xA;&gt; immediately try to get as far away from that water as possible. If you&#xD;&#xA;&gt; were to look at a single tiny bubble in a cup of foamed milk, you'd&#xD;&#xA;&gt; see that the hydrophobic ends of the milk proteins are all pointed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; inwards, towards the water-free interior of the bubble, while the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hydrophilic ends stay put in the aqueous environment the bubbles are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; suspended in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This structure helps keep the air bubbles intact for a long time after the steaming &gt; process, all the way into your cup (and into your happy, soon-to-be caffeinated mouth).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a wonderful article on the topic see:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/12/milk-foam-what-is-microfoam-why-does-milk-foam-what-is-a-cappuccino-coffee.html" />

Coffee contains caffeine which is a stimulant and most stimulants have some degree of laxative effect. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    - If nothing else stimulants will raise your metabolism, so even if it isn't immediate you'll be heading to the bathroom sooner than you would without them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    - It also looks like caffeine causes stimulation of the bowels specifically. &#xD;&#xA;        &gt; coffee can also cause looser stools because increased peristalsis&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; leaves less time for the colon to perform one of its key&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; functions–reabsorbing water from fecal matter to produce well-formed&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; stools. Be aware, however, that other common accompaniments to coffee&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; can be culprits in this matter. Dairy products, excess sugar, even&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; “sugarless” sweeteners like sorbitol (a well-known substance used as a&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; laxative) can cause diarrhea.

The psychological effect  &#xD;&#xA;    - I don't know if there have been any real studies on this, but I strongly suspect that there is some [Classical Conditioning][2] going on. Much like Pavlov's dogs who were conditioned to salivate at the sound of a bell, if your usual morning routine is to have a cup of coffee and then head to the restroom, over time you end up conditioning your self to do this regardless of whether or not the coffee is really &quot;making you poop&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.onemedical.com/blog/eat-well/why-coffee-makes-me-poop/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning" />

There's nothing wrong with it but I think it will be better in a couple of days. I find the aromatic qualities peak about 24-48 hours after roasting, but that may be because the off-gassing process is literally emitting the most fumes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How the flavor changes&#xD;&#xA;Subjectively, I'd say the smell and taste change like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During **early roasting**, there are wood and vegetable smells, like when you put green wood on a fire and it puts out a lot of moisture-filled steam and begins to smoke.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Toward the **end of the roast**, the smell is more from the browning/caramelization/Maillard reaction and smells kind of like burnt toast. Not really much like coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you grind and drink it **immediately after roasting**, it tastes like generic coffee,  with those toasty flavors foreground. Very simple and straightforward without a lot of nuance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**After 24 hours** the toasted character has diminished and the nuances have developed a lot more. You can really notice the difference between bean origins. There is much more powerful rich &quot;amazing coffee&quot; aroma. I find the sheer quantity of aroma very appealing at 24-48 hours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some beans continue to change for **several days after roasting**. Recently I had a batch of Indonesian beans that were still developing and becoming more characteristically Indonesian after a week. I liked them more, but someone else might have liked them less.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And that, when it comes down to it, is what matters. Some people find some varieties more interesting, more palatable or less harsh as they age. But [*de gustibus non est disputandum*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_gustibus_non_est_disputandum).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's amazing the human nose and tongue can sense these differences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## See also&#xD;&#xA;- [&quot;Degassing, resting, and storage&quot; at thecoffeefaq.com](http://www.thecoffeefaq.com/5homeroasting.html#degassing), recommending at least 24 hours&#xD;&#xA;- Sweet Maria's claims coffee is [&quot;at its flavor peak at 12-72 hours&quot;](http://www.sweetmarias.com/freshroast.tipsheet.html) and recommends a [minimum 12-24 hour rest period](http://www.sweetmarias.com/roastedcoffeestorage.php).&#xD;&#xA;- forums like home-barista.com report [much variation on preferred resting time.](https://www.google.com/#q=resting+coffee+site:www.home-barista.com)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This tells me if the latte is too hot to consume. The process also conjures up memories of the [Japanese green tea ceremony](http://youtu.be/Dx6JKEyKdPE?t=8m10s) where two hands are used to drink.

Coffee is a crappy growth medium        and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy.&#xD;&#xA;Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it won’t actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool – but not in the refrigerator.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans you’ve ground yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans. Don’t know how to find amazing, fresh coffee? I wrote a guide on that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No matter what you do, you will not be able to get that fresh flavor back once it has left the bean. The most important thing to do is keep it locked up tight. However, if you are a true coffee lover, it may not sit around long enough to even think about going bad. Just remember this rule of thumb: about two weeks after roast the coffee will start decaying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would close this question as &quot;Too broad&quot; but then.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sourced from http://www.coffeebrewguides.com/ and http://cooking.stackexchange.com/" />

(The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's [Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee](http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Jamaica-Mountain-Coffee/dp/B00GK5R8IG), a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says [it's the best bet](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html) for Trader Joe's coffee.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil.

This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Set up the Aeropress for [inverted brewing](http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/).&#xD;&#xA;2. For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&#xD;&#xA;3. Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a [gooseneck kettle](http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg) for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&#xD;&#xA;4. Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&#xD;&#xA;5. Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&#xD;&#xA;6. Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema." />

This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Differences by Region&#xD;&#xA;-------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in coffee by Country][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Green Processing&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Age of the Coffee&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;![Acid Degradation over Time][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Level of Roast &#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Acidity VS Level of Roast][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Italian&quot; or even &quot;Spanish&quot; roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Questions, Comments, or Clarifications?** Add a comment and I'll be happy to follow up this post! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.Gastrograph.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/5FChz.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9Xa.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn6eJ.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/uajzo.png" />

I've worked with several blends from different companies and have found that some are better with resting than others. What's key here is the flavor added from the aromatics, or the crema.

For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile, so in hot coffee more are evaporating, so you can more easily perceive them, same goes with salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is scetylsalicylic acid). They are also probably more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. So in cold brew not only do you extract fewer, but the ones that you do extract, will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for amino acids, that's a more tricky issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). And most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This article is helpful:https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.Gastrograph.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png" />

So Keeping dose, time, and extraction the same, the only variable was pressure. I found that the most notable change was a *reduction in brightness.* The more pronounced acidity and citric flavors were *dulled*.

This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what is the full story? Read on! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average _more_ acidic than its cold brewed counter part. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Average Flavor Profile&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee][3]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee][4]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and &#xD;&#xA;acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(**Reminder:** Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is _not_ Cold Brew coffee.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. Full Immersion Cold Brew&#xD;&#xA;    - Fresh &#xD;&#xA;    - CO2 Draft&#xD;&#xA;    - Nitrogen Draft &#xD;&#xA;    - Bottled &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  2. Ice Drip &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Draft Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Cold Brew Draft][5]&#xD;&#xA; This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. &#xD;&#xA;![Nitro Cold Brew][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is scetylsalicylic acid). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Amino acids are a more tricky issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6 hour steep time). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This article is helpful:https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.Gastrograph.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png" />

The coffee decoction will get collected in the lower container (See picture 3).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. Boil milk and simmer for a few minutes stirring continuously.

Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter (or fridge) for 24 hours. Strain thoroughly. Reserve the delicious liquid and discard the grounds. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can vary the coffee:water ratio and brewing time depending on your preferences. The concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. To make a cup of hot coffee, add about 2 parts hot water to 1 part cold brew (depending on your taste).

This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what is the full story? Read on! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average _more_ acidic than its cold brewed counter part. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Average Flavor Profile&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee][3]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee][4]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and &#xD;&#xA;acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(**Reminder:** Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is _not_ Cold Brew coffee.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. Full Immersion Cold Brew&#xD;&#xA;    - Fresh &#xD;&#xA;    - CO2 Draft&#xD;&#xA;    - Nitrogen Draft &#xD;&#xA;    - Bottled &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  2. Ice Drip &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Draft Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Cold Brew Draft][5]&#xD;&#xA; This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. &#xD;&#xA;![Nitro Cold Brew][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This article is helpful:https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.Gastrograph.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png" />

Typically, the more expensive a coffee is, the higher quality it will be.  It's the age old phrase, 'You get what you pay for&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Secondly, the less steps from it being picked to it being in your cup, the better.  Packaged, ground coffee has more steps (Packaging, grinding) before being brewed.  Whole bean coffee has less.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third, the longer it's been ground, the longer it has had to degrade.  You'll want to grind your whole-bean coffee as close to the time of brew as possible.  Oxygen will erode the flavor of the coffee over time.  Ground coffee has more surface area to be exposed to oxygen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this addresses what you were asking properly." />

However, even the highest quality plants still need to be tended to and grown in the right environment.  So farming methods and location play a part.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After a coffee cherry is grown and picked, it must be processed to get at the bean.  The fruit must be removed somehow and there are various ways to do this, any or all of which can influence the final flavor of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Those beans are then often sorted to create homogenous lots of coffee beans, some folks will claim that this sorting can influence final outcome as well.  Assuming the green beans are properly stored and shipped, they arrive finally at a roaster.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A roaster has potentially the most influence on the final outcome.  They may blend different lots of beans base on a want for a particular flavor profile (or to save money).  And they decide what roast either fits their business model or is best for the beans.  The very same batch of beans will produce drastically different cups of coffee (or espresso) based on the roast level.  Then there is storage of roasted beans.  Some companies grind their coffee before sale, which increases the rate (drastically) at which coffee stales.  Others sell the beans whole.  These will stale too and the rate depends on storage time and method.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally there is the actual method of brewing.  There is a myriad of methods, with some new ones even invented in the last decade.  Any of which can drastically alter the taste of the final product cup of coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Coffee is such a large industry that there are studies and information out there on each step of the process assuming all other variables the same.  One could literally write a book with multiple chapters covering each step of the process.  You still wouldn't be able to come up with any definitive answers because the final step is someone's taste buds and we all have different preferences.   " />

I personally use a double-walled (which means air-insulated) press with very very fine screens in the plunger. This means my coffee stays hot for quite some time, and I don't commonly have issues with grounds at the bottom of the second cup (it's a 2-cup press). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also spent over $300 for it, hand made in Japan by expert crafters with some beautiful stainless steel hardware framing it. It's actually _guaranteed_ to resonate at a certain frequency if you wet your finger and run it around the rim. I digress. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most presses can have some or all of the following issues:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Grinds leak through the screen on the plunger quite easily, even with a good coarse grind&#xD;&#xA; - Coffee can fall below serving temp before you plunge it if you're not careful&#xD;&#xA; - They are a bit of a pain to clean, most can't go _near_ a dishwasher&#xD;&#xA; - They tend to be rather fragile&#xD;&#xA; - They can stain with certain kinds of water, depending on the glass used&#xD;&#xA; - Some argue that the taste of a coarse grind is inferior to finer grinds (a matter of taste is difficult to document)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The actual mechanics of making the coffee is very simple. Mix the grinds and water, then using a screen, separate the grinds from the water. The taste is going to depend more on how clean the press is, the quality and temperature of the water, the quality of the bean, grind, how long you let it brew, etc. The same holds true for pour-over brews, provided that the filter is decent and doesn't add its own taste.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally prefer my press, but it's really a matter of preference. I don't mind cleaning it, in fact one of the reasons I went with a press a while back was in hopes that the prospect _of_ needing to clean it would slow down my consumption. Didn't work.  I love the consistently-good brews I get out of mine, and I love that it keeps my second cup hot long enough for me to enjoy the first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some people _do_ mind the quirks, and prefer not to use them.

Determine what kind of coffee you are working with. Different kinds of coffee have different amounts of caffeine. USDA-accredited values are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Decaffeinated - 1 mg &#xD;&#xA;* Espresso - 212 mg&#xD;&#xA;* Decaffeinated espresso - 1 mg&#xD;&#xA;* Instant - 3,142 mg&#xD;&#xA;* Instant chicory - 21 mg&#xD;&#xA;* Instant french - 246 mg&#xD;&#xA;* Instant mocha - 360 mg&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The values are for 100 grams. This is best because g can be directly derived from an SI unit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Measure the amount of pulp. If your grounds are already wet, you have coffee pulp. Figure out how much you have by weighing it on a scale; it will help if you keep the pulp in the filter so that it does not spread and create a mess.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Convert the pulp into dry measurements. Do this by subtracting the amount of water you added. You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement. Subtract the weight of the water from the weight of the pulp.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Multiply the dry measurement by the amount of caffeine in that type of coffee. If you made instant coffee and have 2 grams of dry instant, for instance, you will multiply this into 3,142 and divide by 100 for a final answer of 62.84 milligrams of caffeine in the coffee pulp.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Voila! Provided you are pretty skilled at handling and measuring things, you have an accurate answer. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Even though the seal they make is assisted by the inclined plane the filter travles to reach the head, it's still good for the filter to mate properly with the machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I asked my barista about this after Joel mentioned it, and he also said it's a good practice to keep. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;tl;dr; It can't hurt, and it might help, but YMMV on lesser machines.

So in the Futura Mission — the second long-term mission of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station — another Italian&#xD;&#xA;&gt; astronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Italian espresso in orbit. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Its name is ISSpresso.** It takes its name from the International Space&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Station (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first&#xD;&#xA;&gt; capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian&#xD;&#xA;&gt; engineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; European leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; deliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; was selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Agency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and activities to be carried out in the ISS. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;“Italian coffee is a beverage without borders — comments **Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of Lavazza** — and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; space for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Thierry Le Gouès and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually&#xD;&#xA;&gt; just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso — the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; indisputable symbol of made in Italy products — on board the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major&#xD;&#xA;&gt; project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our&#xD;&#xA;&gt; division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.” &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Our aerospace engineers — stated **David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; — have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also&#xD;&#xA;&gt; thanks to Lavazza’s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2&#xD;&#xA;&gt; systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra&#xD;&#xA;&gt; high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological&#xD;&#xA;&gt; challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. Food provides an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian&#xD;&#xA;&gt; espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; home.” &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “ISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS&#xD;&#xA;&gt; national usage rights available to public-private partnership&#xD;&#xA;&gt; initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary&#xD;&#xA;&gt; exploration missions. At the same time, we are also proud to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; contribute to the promotion of the image and spreading of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Made-in-Italy brand at international or better “space”, level.” &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **A coffee break in space.** A prototype of the space coffee machine is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; currently being tested at Argotec’s laboratories and all the necessary&#xD;&#xA;&gt; functional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica –&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Selex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at&#xD;&#xA;&gt; launching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; whom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The ‘corner&#xD;&#xA;&gt; café’ on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffè lungo&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can&#xD;&#xA;&gt; also be rehydrated. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Extra-terrestrial technology.** Every tiniest detail&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering&#xD;&#xA;&gt; challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space&#xD;&#xA;&gt; environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special&#xD;&#xA;&gt; steel tube **designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar.** The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; machine is so complex that it weighs **about 20 kilograms since there&#xD;&#xA;&gt; are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Agency.** ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project&#xD;&#xA;&gt; which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’&#xD;&#xA;&gt; menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have led to international patents, which will be useful both for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; future space missions and immediate terrestrial use...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**tl;dr**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Just found images on The Guardian:][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And on http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/24/space-station-coffee-maker-perfect-espresso&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/LA1Kv.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/RC8Kj.jpg" />

A cappuccino is 1-1 milk to espresso and the latte is 2-1 milk to espresso. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another difference is that the milk is treated differently. In a latte the milk is heated as opposed to being frothed. In a cappuccino the milk is frothed (converted into a microfoam) to about double it's original volume. (If you've ever heated or foamed milk you'll have noticed how the milk changes state as it's being heated.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally the way the milk and espresso are combined is different. In a latte the heated milk and espresso are poured together into a serving cup. Whatever microfoam might have been created while heating the milk is then poured over the top. In a cappuccino the frothed microfoam is poured over the espresso.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It gets more involved than this but I'll let others answer those questions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

This is best because g can be directly derived from an SI unit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Measure the amount of pulp. If your grounds are already wet, you have coffee pulp. Figure out how much you have by weighing it on a scale; it will help if you keep the pulp in the filter so that it does not spread and create a mess.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Convert the pulp into dry measurements. Do this by subtracting the amount of water you added. You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement. Subtract the weight of the water from the weight of the pulp.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Multiply the dry measurement by the amount of caffeine in that type of coffee. If you made instant coffee and have 2 grams of dry instant, for instance, you will multiply this into 3,142 and divide by 100 for a final answer of 62.84 milligrams of caffeine in the coffee pulp.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Voila!

If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually you’d get everything that the grounds have to give.

It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L? No… but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the assistance of common men like me,&#xD;&#xA;![YEAHAHAHA!][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, to clarify the actual number, if Arabica then 1 - 1.5 pounds per cycle and if Robusta 2 - 2.75 pounds.

The temperature that the coffee is brewed at and how well the flask holds that temperature are primary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the coffee stays hot the caffeine level will decrease.

At what point this bacteria become dangerous not only depends on temperature but also how clean the flask was to begin with and what quality water is being used. Clean tap water in the US, brewing coffee in a very clean french press, and placed into an incredibly clean flask could last two weeks (although it would taste terrible and have little caffeine) but if any of those steps is less than ideal there is a good chance of bacteria growth. Some people's guts will handle that bacteria without a problem, other people may get sick.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit: I should point out that as I have researched more I'm less certain about the statement regarding caffeine levels over time. Caffeine should not burn at any temperature coffee is left at, and it does not evaporate. So either experiments that say caffeine levels decrease are wrong or the reason it decreases is not clear. Some suggest that bacteria eats the caffeine, which does tie into why it becomes less safe to drink over time." />

Unused grounds however would add to acidity.&#xD;&#xA; - coffee grounds are considered &quot;green material&quot; in compost lingo which is usually what compost piles need more of, as opposed to brown material that is fairly abundant in average land plots (maybe not for apartment composters).&#xD;&#xA; - coffee grounds attract worms, so even if some bacteria are harmed the worms are compost rock-stars and they make up for it&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A good rule of thumb with composting is everything in moderation, so there is such thing as too much used coffee in the pile.

One scoop of&#xD;&#xA;beans weighs about **12 grams** (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh&#xD;&#xA;once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight&#xD;&#xA;and volume).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if I *eat* that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them&#xD;&#xA;with any amount of water I will be consuming the **120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine**&#xD;&#xA;present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation&#xD;&#xA;exercise. *The strongest **or** biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with&#xD;&#xA;that scoop of beans will have **no more than** 120mg caffeine*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How strong is my cup?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in &#xD;&#xA;[1% (weak) to 1.65% (strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%&#xD;&#xA;considered optimal](http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html) whereas &#xD;&#xA;[&quot;a typical espresso will contain on average will contain 1.8-2.2%&quot;&#xD;&#xA;solids](http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water&#xD;&#xA;(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 30-60mg, or 38mg for&#xD;&#xA;optimal brewed coffee and 60mg for espresso). That would be the upper&#xD;&#xA;limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. But&#xD;&#xA;the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,&#xD;&#xA;so it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per&#xD;&#xA;oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz](http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html). That's&#xD;&#xA;a pretty huge range. It means caffeine is 25-50% of the solids in an ounce of brewed&#xD;&#xA;coffee or 50-83% of the solids in an oz of espresso.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of&#xD;&#xA;beans containing a maximum of 120mg caffeine. So maximum 12 mg per oz,&#xD;&#xA;let's say that's &quot;too strong&quot; above, with around 1.65% solids including (conservatively) 100% of the caffeine. If I brew&#xD;&#xA;it too weak and it ends up 1% solids (60% of the &quot;too strong&quot; solids) I would guess&#xD;&#xA;I'd proportionally get 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg per oz or 72 mg&#xD;&#xA;for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg depending on the&#xD;&#xA;brew strength.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so my typical cup contains **around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee,** or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would say a decent&#xD;&#xA;estimation for &quot;optimal&quot; strength American-style brewed coffee is **80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Bonus corollary/sanity check&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with [7g of ground&#xD;&#xA;coffee](http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-drinks/2733-how-much-grounds-used-make-espresso.html) maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the **64mg/shot** reported by [the USDA and others](https://www.google.com/#q=caffeine%20in%20espresso) is also 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NwqDW.jpg" />

Even cheap coffee tastes much better when it's fresh and freshly ground. Buy a mid-range grinder and two airtight containers (one for whole beans, and one for grounds). At the start of every day, you can grind enough to get you through the day. Coffee is best when it's used within about 2 weeks of being roasted and ground, though it'll still be drinkable longer than that, especially if stored properly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other thing you can do that doesn't cost any money is to experiment with how much coffee you use per pot. I've been in a lot of offices where people assume that more grounds automatically means better coffee, but adding too many grounds can lead to a very unpleasant bitter, metallic, or acidic taste. So try adding slightly less coffee when brewing a fresh pot and see if that helps, even if you don't change anything else." />

Start with a grind size around that of coarse sugar. (Think Sugar in the Raw.)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; How much: Most pourover drippers work best when they're between one&#xD;&#xA;&gt; half to two-thirds full of coffee grounds. Any less than that, and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; there won't be enough coffee to restrict the flow. Any more, and your&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dripper may overflow. You'll also want to make sure you're dripping&#xD;&#xA;&gt; into a large enough vessel. If you're the more precise-measurement&#xD;&#xA;&gt; type, a good coffee-to-water ratio is between 60-70 grams of coffee&#xD;&#xA;&gt; per liter of water (a mass ratio between 1:16 and 1:14.)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  2. Get your clean (filtered if you need it) brew water ready.

Wait for the coffee bed to stop&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the initial swelling (about 30 seconds) before adding more water.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  4. Continue your brew. Try to pour quickly, gently, and evenly across the surface of the coffee, pausing between pours to pace your brew to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your target brew time (see below). The distance that your brew water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; drops can affect brew temperatures, as well as increase or decrease&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the amount of agitation that the falling water creates wherever it&#xD;&#xA;&gt; falls in the coffee bed. In general, the lower you pour from, the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; better, if for no other reason than it's the easiest to create and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; maintain consistency.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; When you stop adding water, your dripper will continue to drip for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; between 20 and 60 seconds.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Your target total brew time is about 2.5 to 3 minutes for dark roasted&#xD;&#xA;&gt; coffee, and 3 to 4 minutes for medium to light roasted coffees.

Grind finer and/or pour slower and you will get a stronger cup of coffee.  Grind courser and pour more quickly and you will get a weaker cup of coffee.  Pouring from the center sometime results in a raised edge around the rim, which isn't ideal when I am trying to fill the cone as full as possible, but in a true pour over, may be fine.  Pouring from the side seems to sometimes result in a small island of dry grounds floating in the middle of the cone.

I know that it sounds trivial, but the quality of water can affect how _any_ coffee tastes. It can render your espresso tart, or turn your Folgers into mud pie soup. This should also result in less build up of 'gunk' in your machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, eliminate your filters as a cause of bad taste. To do this, heat some water to about 95 degrees Celsius, pour it through a few of the filters and into a container to cool. Wait for it to cool, smell and taste the water. Any after taste or odor? You got it from the filters, change your brand. While it's not _always_ true, the more expensive the filter, the better the chance that it's not going to shed fibers or tastes into your brew.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third, have your machine cleaned. Ask any diner who does it for them, and take it to wherever that is. Stuff can build up that a simple cleaning can't handle, the machine should be broken down and cleaned thoroughly, especially if you're getting that vegemite-like 'burnt'  taste to things. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, if Maxwell House is the coffee everyone can agree on, try putting a pinch of kosher salt in the basket with the grinds before you brew - it can _really_ help to bring out latent flavors that might still be in the beans (provided that the coffee is still reasonably fresh), it won't make the coffee taste salty. Not much, 10 crystals or less, but try adding a pinch. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think pound for pound, you'll get the most out of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Having the machine professionally cleaned&#xD;&#xA; - Having better water delivered, and using that to brew&#xD;&#xA; - Tossing a few crystals of kosher salt in with the grinds&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The machine you've got is a classic workhorse, and I'm sure it's got plenty of get-up-and-go left, but it does need to be maintained periodically." />

One scoop of&#xD;&#xA;beans weighs about **12 grams** (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh&#xD;&#xA;once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight&#xD;&#xA;and volume).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if I *eat* that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them&#xD;&#xA;with any amount of water I will be consuming the **120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine**&#xD;&#xA;present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation&#xD;&#xA;exercise. *The strongest **or** biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with&#xD;&#xA;that scoop of beans will have **no more than** 120mg caffeine*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How strong is my cup?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in &#xD;&#xA;[1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%&#xD;&#xA;considered optimal](http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html) whereas &#xD;&#xA;[&quot;a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%&quot;&#xD;&#xA;solids](http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water&#xD;&#xA;(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 30-60mg, or 38mg for&#xD;&#xA;optimal brewed coffee and 60mg for espresso). That would be the upper&#xD;&#xA;limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand,&#xD;&#xA;the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,&#xD;&#xA;so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. [Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per&#xD;&#xA;oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz](http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html). That's&#xD;&#xA;a pretty huge range. But it means caffeine is a lot of what gets dissolved—25-50% of the solids in an ounce of brewed coffee or 50-83% of the solids in an ounce of espresso.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of&#xD;&#xA;beans containing a maximum of 120mg caffeine.

I think it should be roughly ±20% accurate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# For any amount of &quot;good strength&quot; American-style coffee by any brew method, weigh the dry coffee in grams and multiply by 0.08, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Weakly extracted coffee might yield 0.6% of its weight in caffeine and very strongly extracted coffee might get close to 1% caffeine. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These numbers are for typical 100% Arabica or mostly Arabica blends. 100% Robusta beans (uncommon) could be about double the caffeine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Explanation below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Maximum caffeine content&#xD;&#xA;Typical premium roasted Arabica coffee beans like mine contain [close to 1% caffeine by mass when measured by spectrophotometer (p 311)](http://www.academia.edu/6246212/Analytical_Methods_Measurement_of_caffeine_in_coffee_beans_with_UV_vis_spectrometer)&#xD;&#xA;though Robusta (less common and usually blended with Arabica in cheaper coffees) has&#xD;&#xA;[roughly twice that&#xD;&#xA;much](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have a health concern like wanting to stay under the 300 mg guideline for pregnant women, you should be able to use this as the upper limit: **each 10g of Arabica coffee contains about 100mg of caffeine.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I use a 2 Tbsp scoop to measure beans before I grind them. One scoop of&#xD;&#xA;beans weighs about **12 grams** (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh&#xD;&#xA;once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight&#xD;&#xA;and volume).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if I *eat* that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them&#xD;&#xA;with any amount of water I will be consuming the **120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine**&#xD;&#xA;present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation&#xD;&#xA;exercise. *The strongest **or** biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with&#xD;&#xA;that scoop of beans will have **no more than** 120mg caffeine*. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How strong is my cup?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in &#xD;&#xA;[1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%&#xD;&#xA;considered optimal](http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html) whereas &#xD;&#xA;[&quot;a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%&quot;&#xD;&#xA;solids](http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water&#xD;&#xA;(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 30-60mg, or 38mg for&#xD;&#xA;optimal brewed coffee and 60mg for espresso). That would be the upper&#xD;&#xA;limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand,&#xD;&#xA;the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,&#xD;&#xA;so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. [Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per&#xD;&#xA;oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz](http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html). That's&#xD;&#xA;a pretty huge range. But it means caffeine is a lot of what gets dissolved—25-50% of the solids in an ounce of brewed coffee or 50-83% of the solids in an ounce of espresso.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of&#xD;&#xA;beans containing a maximum of 120mg caffeine. So let's say that maximum 12 mg per oz is the &quot;too strong&quot; concentration above, with around 1.65% solids including almost 100% of the caffeine.

Additionally size may be used and beans can be sorted with screens (slightly more automated) to produce lots that appear more consistent in size.  While these things may affect appearance, they are not thought to affect taste (by most) and so all of these will likely be sold.  However, during these same processes, any truly &quot;bad&quot; beans (moldy, unformed, etc) will probably be removed and discarded.  If buyers see significant amounts of bad beans in a lot, it will be assumed that care was not taken in the processing of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I roast at home and the only time I have ever &quot;sorted&quot; is if a bean or two from a previous batch was hidden in my drum and gets BBB'd (burnt beyond belief) in a second roasting process.  Depending on roasting process, there is always a range of time that the beans get to certain points, they don't all hit first crack or second crack at the same time.  If the beans are of sufficient quality and properly sorted after processing (at the source/origin) those ranges will be fairly narrow with not a lot of overlap.  The machine I have now does a fairly good job or mixing the beans during roasting and the roasts I get from it are quite consistent.  If I roast at a lower temperature longer, usually even more so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To answer your question, the higher the quality of green beans and the better the roast technique, the less the need for sorting (if any).  I can hardly see any reason for sorting beans for size/shape after the roasting process.  Roasted coffee should be stored in opaque packaging, and any efforts to unify appearance would be nullified by proper storage.  If there is so much variation in the roast that it needs sorting for flavor, I would suggest that time might be better spent refining the roasting process for consistency.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/264/peaberry-and-coffee-varieties" />

I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts. But the crema and freshness is always long gone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that must secretly be the real reason for a long black—by adding the espresso to the top of drinkable-temperature water, you still have a chance at the best flavors and aromas. As [the Australian coffee roasters Five Senses put it,](http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2011/12/19/the-espresso-menu-explained)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Regardless of the crema, the long black tastes best as it cools slightly from boiling to a drinkable temperature. Only then will you be able to perceive some of the finer nuances and sweetness of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I would shoot to **have the cup around the same temperature as good brewed coffee by the time it hits the drinker's lips**. According to [Coffee Detective,](http://www.coffeedetective.com/what-is-the-correct-temperature-for-serving-coffee.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [American-style brewed] coffee is best served at a temperature between 155ºF and 175ºF (70ºC to 80ºC). Most people prefer it towards the higher end, at about 175ºF.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That means, depending on cup type and ambient temperature, if you draw 200°F hot water from the machine before you start making the espresso and leave it uncovered, it will be roughly the right temperature to serve by the time the shots are ready.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Basically the way it works is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Get a load of volunteers&#xD;&#xA;* By doing questionnaires, work out everything about them&#xD;&#xA;* Track them over a long period of time&#xD;&#xA;* See if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for *causation*, only for *correlation*. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember also that medical studies are *chronically* badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed *wildly*. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One tool against all of this uncertainty is [meta-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis). This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.). You then do some careful statistics work to get a measure of confidence across all of the studies. Think of it as a sophisticated way of 'averaging them out'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[One of these was done](http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174313206X152546) in 2002. Only 4 studies had been done by then, but the conclusion was:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although our pooled estimates show that coffee consumption is inversely associated with the risk of AD, the four studies had heterogeneous methodologies and results. Further prospective studies evaluating the association between coffee consumption and AD are strongly needed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Heterogeneous is science for 'different')&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;i.e., &quot;Not sure yet, not enough data, but it looks promising, give us more money for research.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study" />

Robusta tends to be cheaper than arabica, so this might also be a reason for its use (and the cited &quot;cheapness&quot;) of the cup. If you're used to fancy cafe coffee (which tends to be arabica), it's a rather different (albeit not necessarily unpleasant) experience. See also [this question on arabica and robusta](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/116/262).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Granted, this arabica/robusta distinction is oversimplification, because there are so many varietals, but here's [one article](http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949) on differences. For example, robusta tends to have lower acidity, but higher bitterness. If these are the attributes you attribute, it might be further robusta evidence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you were to learn the brand of coffee being brewed, that might suggest the variety of the beans, but that's probably difficult to learn from generic, anonymous diners." />

So, having a stuffy nose is more likely to reduce the taste of your coffee than drinking it with the lid on.

It's called &quot;cold brew&quot;, but you can still make good hot coffee out of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cold brew is essentially hyperconcentrated, but slow-brewed, coffee. It's very popular in the United States in the summer, because it's very easy to make excellent iced coffee with a cold brew concentrate. (Just add water and ice.) But you can also make a cup of hot coffee out of cold brew concentrate: just add hot water instead of cold water and ice. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Here's a recipe](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-coffee-concentrate-to-serve-hot-coffee-to-a-crowd-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-187198), but I'll summarize it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You need: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* ~12 oz coarsely ground coffee&#xD;&#xA;* ~6 cups water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pour water over coffee in a large bowl or pitcher and stir. Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter (or fridge) for 24 hours. You can vary the coffee:water ratio and brewing time depending on your preferences.Strain thoroughly. Reserve the delicious liquid and discard the grounds.  The concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make a cup of hot coffee, add about 2 parts hot water to 1 part cold brew (depending on your taste). Add the hot water slowly until it's tasty to you. Dilute with a similar amount of cold water for iced coffee - then add ice. Add milk, sugar, and other fixings as desired. (If you're drinking it iced, you'll want to use [simple syrup](http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/simple-syrup) to sweeten, since plain sugar won't dissolve well in cold liquid.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bon appetit!" />

And I must say, this one is new. I have never heard of warming the coffee itself. I can't imagine that, at the temperature at which the brew head usually resides, many significant changes are made in just a few moments of warming the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The closest I've heard to this is that some believe in the opposite. A fellow once told me to leave my spent puck in the portafilter if someone was going to be brewing again shortly. He claimed this helped retain heat in the portafilter. Though the science checks out, the results proved marginal and pretty much just made you the lazy guy using the espresso machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in closing, I'd say that the effects of warming your coffee are probably negligible, and that you can get more crema more easily through other means (buying better quality coffee, adjusting your brewing variables, etc)" />

There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept (stovetop coffee production devices), they're (to me) totally different in outcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suspect, but I don't know, if there are regional differences in these terms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Full disclosure: this [meta question](http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/q/60/262) and [my answer](http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/a/74/262) prompted this adaptation as a clarification question." />

The [World Barista Championship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Barista_Championship) specifies the proper construction in their [beverage definitions (.PDF)](http://www.worldbaristachampionship.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2015-WBC-FINAL.pdf) in §2.2.2. It consists of a single-shot of espresso (25 mL / ~0.8 fl. oz.), textured (steamed) milk, and *at least* 1 cm of foam (other places suggest 2 cm). Total volume is 150-180 mL / 5-6 fl. oz.  To the extent that you subscribe to the WBC being a benchmark, the **components**, **volume**, and **amount of foam** define physical properties of a properly made cappuccino. It also states that the components should be in &quot;harmonious balance.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The WBC states that aspects of the service are also crucial, such as&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **visual appearance**, such as that the beverage should fill the cup;&#xD;&#xA;* **served with accoutrements**, such as &quot;spoon, napkin and unflavoured water&quot;;&#xD;&#xA;* **logistical aspects** of drinking, such as temperature and holding the cup.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, there's a lot of variability that might lean closer to personal preference. Some other topics mentioned at WBC and Wikipedia include being &quot;wet&quot; (referring to the foam, versus &quot;dry&quot;), and &quot;traditional&quot; (solid central circle of white foam, versus having [latte art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_art)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other recipes for cappuccino at home vary greatly:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Folgers suggests](http://www.folgerscoffee.com/coffee-how-to/how-to-videos/cappuccino) to use equal parts of coffee (French press or drip), steamed milk, and foam.

If you experience&#xD;&#xA;&gt; five or more symptoms, such as red face, nervousness and restlessness,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; during or right after your cup of Joe, you may be diagnosed with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; coffee intoxication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to a new edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), excessive caffeine intake can lead to a condition known as “caffeine intoxication,”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words, **caffeine withdrawal is now a recognized disorder, and is listed in the [DSM-5][5].**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “**Caffeine is a drug, a mild stimulant**, which is used by almost&#xD;&#xA;&gt; everybody on a daily basis,” said Dr. Charles O’Brien, who chairs the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Substance-Related Disorder Work Group for DSM-5 (via New York Post).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “But it does have a letdown afterwards. If you drink a lot of coffee,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; at least two or three [236 ml] cups at a time, there will be a rebound&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or withdrawal effect.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are [top 10 caffeine withdrawal symptoms][6]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

Text="The biggest chemical change that is going to occur is going to be **oxidation.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oxidation&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chemically, oxidation is defined as the following from [this source.][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons&#xD;&#xA;&gt; are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different&#xD;&#xA;&gt; compounds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Specifically related to coffee, oxidation is further elaborated upon as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates&#xD;&#xA;&gt; two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oxidation of coffee occurs when oxygen molecules (present in the air in your flask and also dissolved in the water used to brew the coffee) come into contact with different compounds in the coffee. Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Loss of heat&#xD;&#xA;------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Answering your final question about duration of freshness:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. **The sooner you drink it the better.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What You Can Do&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask.** You might also look into cold brewing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to read more about these chemical processes as they apply to coffee throughout the preparation process (roasting, grinding, brewing), then you can check out this resource.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Black Bear Coffee][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81" />

This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Differences by Region&#xD;&#xA;-------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in coffee by Country][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Green Processing&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Age of the Coffee&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;![Acid Degradation over Time][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Level of Roast &#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Acidity VS Level of Roast][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Italian&quot; or even &quot;Spanish&quot; roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt.

This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what is the full story? Read on! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average _more_ acidic than its cold brewed counter part. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Average Flavor Profile&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee][3]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee**&#xD;&#xA;![Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee][4]&#xD;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and &#xD;&#xA;acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(**Reminder:** Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is _not_ Cold Brew coffee.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. Full Immersion Cold Brew&#xD;&#xA;    - Fresh &#xD;&#xA;    - CO2 Draft&#xD;&#xA;    - Nitrogen Draft &#xD;&#xA;    - Bottled &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  2. Ice Drip &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Draft Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Cold Brew Draft][5]&#xD;&#xA; This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. &#xD;&#xA;![Nitro Cold Brew][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This article is helpful:https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.Gastrograph.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png" />

This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Differences by Region&#xD;&#xA;-------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Sour &amp; Acidity in coffee by Country][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Green Processing&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Age of the Coffee&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;![Acid Degradation over Time][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Level of Roast &#xD;&#xA;-------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Acidity VS Level of Roast][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Italian&quot; or even &quot;Spanish&quot; roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, &lt;strike&gt;and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible.&lt;/strike&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; roasting process (at about 120 sec).

In a latte the heated milk and espresso are poured together into a serving cup. Whatever microfoam might have been created while heating the milk is then poured over the top.

(The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's [Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee](http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Jamaica-Mountain-Coffee/dp/B00GK5R8IG), a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says [it's the best bet](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html) for Trader Joe's coffee.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Set up the Aeropress for [inverted brewing](http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/).&#xD;&#xA;2. For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&#xD;&#xA;3. Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a [gooseneck kettle](http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg) for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&#xD;&#xA;4. Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&#xD;&#xA;5. Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&#xD;&#xA;6. Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* My results vary significantly. I *think* the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&#xD;&#xA;* I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process." />

The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think **you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub**. However, **any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew** (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also [this question about coffee going stale](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262) -- one answer says it only takes minutes!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wet coffee grounds will mould if allowed to sit too long** as you report. So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote [this question/answer on Cooking.SE](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286) recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A probably-obvious alternative is to use a paper filter. You could toss the whole thing into your compost bin (filter and spent grounds and all!) and everything on the coffee maker will dry out more quickly. &#xD;&#xA;" />

Text="The method of brewing you describe is commonly known in Poland, Belarus, etc, as 'Turkish coffee', althought it's something very different from the actual 'Turkish coffee', because coffee is poured over by hot water, like tea, and not boiled afterwards. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, many people use sprinkled tea instead of express tea (express tea, or sachet tea is usually of much poorer quality). But many people dislike that method because of grounds that must be manually removed before washing the cup.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The grounds of the coffee are very small grained, so they won't stop the sink, and I suppose it's the reason there's not so much demand on coffee sachets. Another one is the popularity of coffee machines, with nothing similar in the tea world. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The last reason that I see is, because coffee grounds are much smaller, it's technologically more challenging to prepare coffee sachets that would keep grounds inside. So they would be (and from I've heard actually are) much more expensive, and not so many people are eager to pay extra for them." />

Text="Looks like a standard metal mesh reusable filter! The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think **you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub**. However, **any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew** (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also [this question about coffee going stale](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262) -- one answer says it only takes minutes! And [this question about what's happening](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/160/262) with stale coffee.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wet coffee grounds will mould if allowed to sit too long** as you report. So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote [this question/answer on Cooking.SE](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286) recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A probably-obvious alternative is to use a paper filter. You could toss the whole thing into your compost bin (filter and spent grounds and all!) and everything on the coffee maker will dry out more quickly. &#xD;&#xA;" />

Most coffee beans are grown ***just like that***. They require shade or they will die of too much sunlight. Having too much water will sometimes drown the plant to death. Here is a [website][1] that lists three main disadvantages and some advantages to shade grown coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Too much shade will cause fungal infections&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the plant is under too much shade, fungi-related infections will attack and feed on the plant. This will ruin your plant and destroy it. Yet having too much sunlight will burn the plant instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The real definition of shade-grown is not really rock-solid. Many places will have varying amounts of shade due to their altitudes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can't say that this type of shade gown plant is used in every country of different altitudes.. Some places require more shade (those with a high altitude) and others less shade (those with a low altitude). It depends on where you will plant your coffee plant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The further south (or, north) a farm is located from the Equator, the less need there is for shade cover to protect coffee plants from the rays of the sun: the strength of the sun's rays in, for example, Brazil (where the sun is at an angle) is far less than the direct overhead rays from Central America. Thus, while shade cover may prove advantageous in Central America it might actually lead to a fall in yield of crops in Brazil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This directly copied from the website, word for word. The amount of shade needed will also depends on the sunlight's strength. Nearer the equator, it is stronger so more shade is required. Farther from the equator, it is weaker so less shade is needed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are maybe more, but these are some basic and critical disadvantages to shad grown planting.

In this [website][1]. it states that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Today, most white paper filters are whitened with oxygen. Oxygen whitening is much more friendly to the environment, and imparts no taste to the filter. Brown filters are simply unwhitened. Your choice, but oxygen whitened filters are usually less expensive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Brown filters are just plain without any improvements. Surprisingly, they are more expensive yet yields the same flavor as a white filter here. Trying to save money, get a white one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Speaking of Performance...&#xD;&#xA;In this [website][2],it states that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Natural brown : In its natural form, all paper is brown colored, so brown filters are completely unprocessed. Other than aesthetics and processing, there are no other differences in color.&#xD;&#xA;- White : White paper filters are processed to get that clean, white shade. Chlorine bleaching or natural oxygen bleaching are common methods for whitening paper. Generally, better quality paper ones do not use chlorine bleach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Avoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though. Look online like in Amazon for high quality paper filters and look at the reviews.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Taste&#xD;&#xA;Yep, some brown paper filters will add some extra taste to your coffee, sometimes not that good:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Melitta 'whites' are best. I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the [website][3] where all the information of this section came from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Environmental Impacts&#xD;&#xA;Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the [website][4] that provided the paragraph.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;Not a lot of differences that are outright clear, but there are minor differences between the two.

Caffeine has been shown to temporarily raise blood pressure, and reduces blood flow to inactive limbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like many drugs, caffeine is [chemically addictive][1] and recent publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), caffeine withdrawal was finally included as a mental disorder for the first time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Soon after you drink coffee (containing caffeine), it’s absorbed through the small intestine and dissolved into the bloodstream and it’s able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regular ingestion of the drug (i.e. coffee/tea, soda or energy drinks) alters your brain’s chemistry and physical characteristics actually change over time, leading to fatigue, headaches and nausea if you try to quit. However, compared to many drug addictions, the effects are relatively short-term.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Few quotes from [Daily Mail][2]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Large amounts of **caffeine can cause heart palpitations, fits and even death**, as well as raising the risk of Type 2 diabetes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Heavy consumption has also been linked to **a greater risk of depression, addiction and alcohol dependency**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Energy drinks could be more likely to cause a caffeine overdose because they can be drunk quickly, unlike hot drinks like tea or coffee, the Energy Drink Consumption in Europe study said.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Several deaths worldwide have been linked to excessive consumption of energy drinks, although scientists say more research is needed to prove a link.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Recommended maximum caffeine intake is about 400mg per day – equivalent to around five cups of filter coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;'Reproductive-aged women (⩽ 300 mg caffeine per day) and children are ‘at risk’ subgroups who may require specific advice on moderating their caffeine intake', [study][3] said.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On [Live Science][4] we can read:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Coffee drinking could lead to a mental disorder. If you experience&#xD;&#xA;&gt; five or more symptoms, such as red face, nervousness and restlessness,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; during or right after your cup of Joe, you may be diagnosed with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; coffee intoxication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to a new edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), excessive caffeine intake can lead to a condition known as “caffeine intoxication,”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words, **caffeine withdrawal is now a recognized disorder, and is listed in the [DSM-5][5].**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “**Caffeine is a drug, a mild stimulant**, which is used by almost&#xD;&#xA;&gt; everybody on a daily basis,” said Dr. Charles O’Brien, who chairs the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Substance-Related Disorder Work Group for DSM-5 (via New York Post).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “But it does have a letdown afterwards. If you drink a lot of coffee,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; at least two or three [236 ml] cups at a time, there will be a rebound&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or withdrawal effect.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are [top 10 caffeine withdrawal symptoms][6]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Headache&#xD;&#xA;1. Sleepiness&#xD;&#xA;1. Irritability&#xD;&#xA;1. Lethargy&#xD;&#xA;1. Constipation&#xD;&#xA;1. Depression&#xD;&#xA;1. Muscle Pain/Stiffness&#xD;&#xA;1. Lack of Concentration&#xD;&#xA;1. Flu-like symptoms&#xD;&#xA;1.

So drinking it will end up with headache, fast heartbeat, heart palpitations and even death, so it require emergency care as soon as possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is SAMHSA data of emergency department visits related to misuse of energy drinks (energy drinks can be looked at as caffeine) and it is really alarming:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Number of ED Visits with adverse reaction to caffeine overdose.][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SAMHSA report puts it: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Large amounts of caffeine can cause adverse effects such as insomnia,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; nervousness, headache, fast heartbeat, and seizures that are severe&#xD;&#xA;&gt; enough to require emergency care.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - (article) [Sales of sugar and caffeine laden energy drinks should be restricted as they 'pose a danger' to children][11] at Daily Mail&#xD;&#xA; - [What's the minimum recommended age for drinking a coffee?][12]&#xD;&#xA; - [This Is How Your Brain Becomes Addicted to Caffeine][13] at Smithsonian&#xD;&#xA; - [What Caffeine Actually Does to Your Brain][14] at Life Hacker&#xD;&#xA; - (study) [Effects of Caffeine on Human Health][15], P.

The flavor will be enhanced rather than the quick brew time with a large fire. So flavor and brew time can be changed depending on the size of your heat.

It lets the good stuff go through and keeps the bad stuff out (if it is high-quality or just decent enough).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your second question. So siphons so use metal filters, but they are either rare or even not produced anymore. Your cloth description is right:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A piece of cloth can however get dirty, rough, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;if you don't know when or how to clean it. In good quality plus cleaning, they can be used up to 100 times or even more. In this site (which states all types of filters and how to change them), it says that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;My cleaning regimen for cloth filters has changed over the years. Cloth filter assemblies should be cleaned right after use with a soft brush and running water, and then soaked in a solution of oxyclean and boiling water. Rinse well after, and store dry. &#xD;&#xA;This will not harm the cloth like bleach will, and it comes out sparkling white and odor free.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oxyclean is a product that is like washing detergent. Cleans up cloth and fabric quickly and nicely, bringing out good results. Boiling water will help out with the cleaning and disinfecting of the cloth. It will literally burn and kill any harmful bacteria on your cloth. You should clean the cloth immediately after use. This will keep the cloth in top-shape for a *long* time in its &quot;life&quot; span.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paper filters' cleaning ways are obvious. One use and they are thrown right into the trash. You really can't clean paper filters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cleaning glass filters (in my opinion) should be cleaned right after used. They are pretty rare and easily broken when not receiving enough care. Just clean it like any other glass product. Put water on a paper towel and wipe it clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The rough (but not sharp) surface of the middle was the filter - coffee grounds would get trapped in the little channels between the bumps, but liquid would still pass through. In practice, these glass filters allow a fair amount of sediment to pass into the brewed coffee. Some find this beneficial, others do not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The choice of using this filter is your decision depending on what you want from your filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nylon mesh are easily cleaned: they're dishwasher safe. Yet, they are breakable and fragile at the same time. Be careful with these guys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps you and answers your questions!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   [1]:http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee" />

You pour the coffee from your cup into the saucer and sip it - usually quite noisily - after blowing a little on it (to cool it). Dricka på fat (drink from a plate, i.e. saucer) can be combined with dricka på bit (drink with a lump, i.e. lump of sugar). You take the lump of sugar between your teeth and sip your coffee (from the saucer) through the sugar. &#xD;&#xA;Neither of these customs are, however, common in polite society... And, generally speaking, I've only ever seen older people do it, years ago, and in the countryside. &#xD;&#xA;Today's urban and international Swedes are more likely to have a latte - without sugar - in a tall glass, no saucer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, you shouldn't do this in public - it's impolite. You could do it alone in the privacy of your house though. @hoc_age got this part right:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In fact, it seems that people would drink both from the cup and from the saucer: After being served a hot beverage (e.g., coffee or tea) in a cup on top of a saucer, some would pour a small amount of the beverage onto the saucer, and then drink from the saucer. There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This pretty much explains this abnormal Swedish tradition.

Because their focus was a mass market they tried to divine what was palatable to the largest audience and tried to produce &quot;a perfect coffee&quot; when what they probably should have been doing was trying to find &quot;perfect coffees&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Malcolm Gladwell gave an excellent Ted Talk entitled:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Choice, happiness and spaghetti sauce][1]  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would really encourage you to watch the whole talk but here's an excerpt that makes the point pretty well:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;About 15 minutes in...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And the reason we thought that -- in other words, people in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cooking world were looking for cooking universals. They were looking&#xD;&#xA;&gt; for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; changed, right? What is the great revolution in science of the last&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 10, 15 years? It is the movement from the search for universals to the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; understanding of variability. Now in medical science, we don't want to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; know how necessarily -- just how cancer works, we want to know how&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human&#xD;&#xA;&gt; variability. What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, this same&#xD;&#xA;&gt; revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce. And for that,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; we owe him a great vote of thanks.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -- oh, I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step, which was to say that when we pursue universal principles&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in food, we aren't just making an error; we are actually doing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ourselves a massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafe. If I&#xD;&#xA;&gt; were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy, and then I asked&#xD;&#xA;&gt; you to rate that coffee, the average score in this room for coffee&#xD;&#xA;&gt; would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. If, however, you allowed me&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffee&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clusters, and I could make coffee just for each of those individual&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78. The difference&#xD;&#xA;&gt; between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that makes you wince, and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce" />

Inside, outside, both? Soak? Hot or cold water?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can't really rinse ***only*** the outside/inside of a paper filter. When you drop water on a piece of paper, it doesn't just stick onto the outside/inside, it soaks ***both*** sides of the paper filter. So, both sides. You probably want to soak your filter. This will get rid of any unnecessary chemicals and oils filtered from your filter. This will help make your coffee taste better. Your Serious Eats article is ***very*** accurate. Well, soaking in hot water should do. Hot water will might peal off some paper plus a lot of harmful stuff. It is one-kill wonder for bacteria. The hot water will burn your harmful bacteria to death. So answering your first question: Both, Yes, Hot Water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now let's answer your second question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How does it help?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, filters are needed to keep coffee clean by extracting and &quot;keeping&quot; the chemicals and oils. Then, what cleans the filters? This is where rinsing comes in. Let me show you an example. Your clothes keep you clean then you put them in the washing machine to get them clean. So the rinsing is just like the washing machine. Over time, the paper will absorb so many chemicals and oils, the performance goes down like a rock. Some trapped chemicals will join the coffee, allowing the coffee to be contaminated and less tasty. Rinsing will allow the hot water to kill the bacteria and let the filter transfer the chemicals to the water, where it will belong somewhere in a sewer. This will leave the filter very clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And now I will answer your bonus question (Do you award extra rep for this ;-)?): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;What is being rinsed off?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, the chemicals and oils of course! As said in my previous answer, the water will take the chemicals and oils to the sewer with it. The pores in which the filter needs to cleanse are then empty and more useful. Paper sometimes peel off but will end in the sewer like the chemicals and the water. After one use, it is time for the trash. Of course, first-timers will have to learn that dust and other particles will also ruin the flavor and filter. That is really the &quot;dusty stuff&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Bonus Information About Your Experiments:&#xD;&#xA;Looks like they don't work. Sure, most coffee filters will add a papery taste to your coffee, depending on its quality. First, doing the first experiment doesn't really do anything. You need to add coffee, not water, to see a difference. An bad, uncleaned filter will add a papery taste plus some more unwanted taste into your coffee. A good, rinsed filter will add a tiny papery taste to your coffee. Adding something in which it has flavor will make the experiment more fun (a lot more coffee to taste) and effective. That also goes to your second experiment which almost is the first experiment itself for some reason... Anyways, chewing paper filters will **absolutely** not do anything. All that does is leave you complaining and spitting for the next 12 hours. You might need a mint and some mouthwash after that for personal hygiene reasons :-).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps you!" />

Though it certainly depends on the preparation method (&quot;method of extraction&quot;, e.g., drip, moka, espresso, cold-brew, ...), the recommended extraction amount is **about 20%** (i.e., about 20% of the mass of the beans/grounds ends up in the brewed coffee). &#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;**Less than ~15%-18% extraction is considered &quot;under-extracted&quot; and can be sour.** That is, under-extraction is not just a matter of inefficiency: the result can be sour and unbalanced due to the  more of the acids are extracted sooner).&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, **more than ~22%-25% extraction is considered &quot;over-extracted&quot; and can be bitter**, because the bitter compounds are extracted later in the brewing process.

It lets the good stuff go through and keeps the bad stuff out (if it is high-quality or just decent enough).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your second question. So siphons so use metal filters, but they are either rare or even not produced anymore. Your cloth description is right:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A piece of cloth can however get dirty, rough, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;if you don't know when or how to clean it. In good quality plus cleaning, they can be used up to 100 times or even more. In this [site][1] (which states all types of filters and how to change them), it says that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;My cleaning regimen for cloth filters has changed over the years. Cloth filter assemblies should be cleaned right after use with a soft brush and running water, and then soaked in a solution of oxyclean and boiling water. Rinse well after, and store dry. &#xD;&#xA;This will not harm the cloth like bleach will, and it comes out sparkling white and odor free.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oxyclean is a product that is like washing detergent. Cleans up cloth and fabric quickly and nicely, bringing out good results. Boiling water will help out with the cleaning and disinfecting of the cloth. It will literally burn and kill any harmful bacteria on your cloth. You should clean the cloth immediately after use. This will keep the cloth in top-shape for a *long* time in its &quot;life&quot; span.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paper filters' cleaning ways are obvious. One use and they are thrown right into the trash. You really can't clean paper filters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cleaning glass filters (in my opinion) should be cleaned right after used. They are pretty rare and easily broken when not receiving enough care. Just clean it like any other glass product. Put water on a paper towel and wipe it clean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The rough (but not sharp) surface of the middle was the filter - coffee grounds would get trapped in the little channels between the bumps, but liquid would still pass through. In practice, these glass filters allow a fair amount of sediment to pass into the brewed coffee. Some find this beneficial, others do not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The choice of using this filter is your decision depending on what you want from your filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nylon mesh are easily cleaned: they're dishwasher safe. Yet, they are breakable and fragile at the same time. Be careful with these guys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps you and answers your questions!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   [1]:http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee" />

You place a small plastic pod into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage. In simple point of fact, **this is not how espresso is *traditionally* made**, so it might be disqualified on that trivial issue alone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you subscribe to the [INEI](http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html) being a benchmark of [espresso production standards (PDF)](http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf), it doesn't meet those requirements; so **it's not an espresso on technicality alone**, with regard to &quot;Certified Italian Espresso&quot; at least. For example: I see no way (nor any evidence) that this machine could create anywhere near 9 bar of pressure -- or even 6 bar of pressure, [as stated by this answer](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262) as being the minimum to produce crema. That said, [it seems that AeroPress can create crema](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress), so perhaps the pods are more like the AeroPress than espresso.[1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Maybe.&#xD;&#xA;There have been several taste-tests of varying &quot;legitimacy&quot; between pod-based machines and espresso machines. [One four-subject test](http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/) gave *higher marks* to the beverage produced from a pod-based machine than an actual espresso machine. [This one](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/) agrees. Another test disagreed, [giving a pod-based machine a scathing review](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you note, the result is similar, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a pod machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What about if the beverage was indistinguishable from espresso?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This also brings up a slightly different question... **What characteristics define real espresso?** See also [this history of espresso machines and production techniques](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~bob/Coffee/timeline.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##It doesn't matter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage is a decent replica of proper espresso. It's also likely to produce a *consistent* result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), **what difference does it make if it's *&quot;real&quot;* espresso or not?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;[1] Is AeroPress espresso? I think not, but that's a separate question also...&lt;/sub&gt;" />

For my version, I use freshly roasted beans from my local farmer's market (they roast on site), Coconut Oil, and Stevia as a sweetener. I also use a [mini aerator][1] from ikea ($2.49) to mix it. This is very important unless you like an oily film on top of your coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; I use organic Coconut Oil rather than Grass fed butter for two reasons: &#xD;&#xA; 1. Coconut Oil is much easier for me to find&#xD;&#xA; 2. IMO, it tastes better than the butter&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tried the grass fed butter, and it was pretty good, but like I said. The coconut oil is much easier to find in stores and it actually tastes better. The butter does give the coffee a creamy texture that's good though, so I'd try both just to see which one you like better. I tried the MCT oil for a while and noticed that it can be a tad harsh on my digestive system, so I cut it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for results, in addition to having a significant boost in energy in the AM, I also noticed health benefits. My good cholesterol (HDL) was through the roof at my last physical. While my LDL was really low. My Doc asked what I was eating, and I told him about my Bulletproof experiment and he said it appears to be working at least for my HDL.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for added benefits for workouts, I don't really notice a huge difference with coffee alone. When I add a NO2 booster to the bulletproof coffee, I do feel a big difference, but that may not be for everyone. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I said all that to say, it does work...to an extent. But I'd definitely advocate a DIY version rather than buying a bunch of overpriced products with highly questionable added benefits. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps.

Paper filters win on performance, clean-up, and health. Flavour is personal preference. Composting paper filters and spent grounds alleviates most of the environmental benefit of permanent filter.  **My conclusion: paper filters, discarded into a compost pile, win hands down.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Use of permanent versus one-time-use filters is a perennial question, with both concrete and personal-preference arguments. In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [1] pretty good [pro/con overview from air-n-water](http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm) (obscure?);&#xD;&#xA;* [2] from [World of Caffeine](http://worldofcaffeine.com/2011/06/20/filter-drip-coffee-paper-vs-metal-filters/);&#xD;&#xA;* [3] from [LiveStrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/281062-health-effects-of-gold-coffee-filters/), which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);&#xD;&#xA;* [4] from [Melitta](http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html), but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written *a lot of text* here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on ***paper versus metal mesh***, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Material.** There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* metal mesh (stainless steel or &quot;gold tone&quot;);&#xD;&#xA;* nylon (or other plastic) mesh;&#xD;&#xA;* perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);&#xD;&#xA;* fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also [this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Performance.** Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as [cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262)). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some *good* things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Flavour.** Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Cost.** Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for &quot;years&quot; for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Clean-up.** Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about [how often and how much to clean a permanent filter](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time). On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Waste / environmental issues.** I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to [rinse your paper filters](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use), so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**My Conclusion.** For my money, personally, **I prefer the paper filter:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);&#xD;&#xA;* Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);&#xD;&#xA;* I compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.&#xD;&#xA;* Marginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).&#xD;&#xA;" />

I have furthermore been unable to avoid philosophical diversion and hypothetical questions in this answer; please forgive me. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As @EricPlaton noted in comments, the answer depends on a slightly different question: **What characteristics define real espresso?** Here I merely compare the beverages produced by the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* a *traditional espresso machine* (See [this history of espresso machines and production techniques](http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~bob/Coffee/timeline.html) for one view of what is *traditionally* espresso), and &#xD;&#xA;* *capsule-based &quot;espresso&quot; systems*. There are several capsule-based espresso machines ([here's a review of Nespresso and three others](http://www.coffeereview.com/three-new-capsule-espresso-systems/)). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. &quot;pod&quot;, made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My answers:&#xD;&#xA;##No.&#xD;&#xA;In simple point of fact, **espresso is not *traditionally* made with a coffee-filled capsule**, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you subscribe to the [INEI](http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html) being a benchmark of [espresso production standards (PDF)](http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf), **capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone**, with regard to &quot;Certified Italian Espresso&quot; at least. For example: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. quantity of coffee (e.g., [Nespresso might be light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso)); &#xD;&#xA; 2. hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam); &#xD;&#xA; 3. Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) *do* produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by [using pressure that is too high](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure), or on the other hand [too low](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262) for extraction and crema. That said, [it seems that AeroPress can create crema](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress) at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Maybe.&#xD;&#xA;There have been several taste-tests of questionable &quot;legitimacy&quot; between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. [One four-subject test](http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/) gave *higher marks* to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. [This one](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/) agrees. Another test disagreed, [giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/). Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##It doesn't matter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a *consistent* result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), **what difference does it make if it's *&quot;real&quot;* espresso or not?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;[1] Is AeroPress espresso? I think not (and @Chris in AK agreed and notes &quot;Aerpresso&quot; in comments!), but that's a separate question also...&lt;/sub&gt;" />

I end up with a relatively crema-y shot. You'd never mistake it for one from an espresso machine, but there's a good layer all across the top. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is completely unscientific and I can't identify which steps here are the relevant ones for the good results, but maybe if you experiment with some of these adjustments you can identify what works and what doesn't. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Equipment&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Aeropress&#xD;&#xA;* Scoop that came with the Aeropress&#xD;&#xA;* [Ultra fine mesh filter](http://www.amazon.com/Filter-AeroPress-Ultra-Stainless-Coffee/dp/B00A1GVVMY)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Coffee&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The beans I use vary; I generally grab a light or medium roast off the shelves at Trader Joes and grind it one click down from the finest setting on the in-store grinder. (The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's [Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee](http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Jamaica-Mountain-Coffee/dp/B00GK5R8IG), a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says [it's the best bet](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html) for Trader Joe's coffee.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Set up the Aeropress for [inverted brewing](http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/).&#xD;&#xA;2. For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&#xD;&#xA;3. Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a [gooseneck kettle](http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg) for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&#xD;&#xA;4. Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&#xD;&#xA;5. Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&#xD;&#xA;6. Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* My results vary significantly. I *think* the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&#xD;&#xA;* I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit Redux:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I [mentioned below](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress/165#comment772_165), all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and [an app full of AeroPress recipes](http://aeropresstimer.com); thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally. I'll track the results [here](https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0) and update this answer when and if I come up with a reliable way to generate and preserve the foam on my AeroPress shots." />

The method was to put a couple of fistfuls of loose grounds in one of those giant porcelain coffee pots that look like they came out of a Zane Grey novel.  Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds.  Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils.  Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside.  Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good.  My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise.  The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I couldn't believe it would work as well as it did but I'm a believer.

Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter (or fridge) for 24 hours. You can vary the coffee:water ratio and brewing time depending on your preferences. Strain thoroughly. Reserve the delicious liquid and discard the grounds. The concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make a cup of hot coffee, add about 2 parts hot water to 1 part cold brew (depending on your taste). Add the hot water slowly until it's tasty to you. Dilute with a similar amount of cold water for iced coffee - then add ice. Add milk, sugar, and other fixings as desired. (If you're drinking it iced, you'll want to use [simple syrup](http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/simple-syrup) to sweeten, since plain sugar won't dissolve well in cold liquid.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bon appetit!" />

You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage). Generally in the pantry in an opaque, air-tight container. I one-way valve is recommended as recently roasted beans will emit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. I bought a stack of [250g resealable foil bags with the one-way valve](http://fivesenses.com.au/shop/associated/250g-empty-bags) from a local roaster and would use each bag a few times. These days I use [AirScape canisters](http://planetarydesign.com/products/airscape-kitchen-canisters/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [The water you use.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017143359/http://dailyshotofcoffee.com/great-coffee-starts-with-the-right-water/) If you wouldn't enjoy drinking your tap water, don't use it to brew coffee. Use the same water you use for drinking water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* The amount of water you put in the Aeropress vs. the amount of water and/or milk you add afterwards (if any).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* How vigorously you stir with the paddle. Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&amp;deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. [This video](http://www.tested.com/food/coffee/455840-how-important-coffee-brew-water-temperature/) gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[3] I did mention people can become amazingly pedantic, didn't I?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[4] Known as the [Ross Droplet Technique](http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/ross-droplet-technique-eliminating-grinder-static-t24051.html)" />

For example, I like working with green beans that came just a few months ago at most, after they get stable in their new climate. After roasting, the best taste comes up 2-3 days later in our case. And brewing comes right after grinding---always. This example is for illustration purpose; numbers may not serve elsewhere.

It has accumulated coffee residue in it from 5+ years of hard service, whilst receiving in return what I shall politely call &quot;inadequate cleansing.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's a double-wall vacuum container. There is no heating element, so I'm not exactly sure what causes this buildup in the first place. The [manufacturer user manual](https://www.cuisinart.com/share/pdf/manuals/dtc-975bkn.pdf) suggests to clean using dish soap / mild detergent, or the top rack of a dishwasher; I've tried both, neither worked. I have also tried scrubbing with non-abrasive brush, sponge, and dish detergents; improved, still lots of residue. I soaked in two batches of near-boiling water and bicarb (baking soda) for about an hour. The first rinse looked almost like brewed coffee; this was *shocking*. After all that, the situation was improved but there's still lots of residue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are myriad suggestions for removing coffee *stains* from stainless steel, like [this set of eight (8) from Wikihow](http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Coffee-Stains-from-a-Stainless-Steel-Pot). It suggests exposing the inside to various household chemicals: vinegar, baking soda / bicarb, bleach (!?), salt, ice cubes, etc. This [other article suggests using a *dishwasher* detergent tablet](http://www.simplyorganized.me/2012/08/how-to-clean-stainless-coffee-pot.html) but it uses anonymous tablets. It does give a nod to using dishwasher detergent powder (as I did [with this other device](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286)), but I'd prefer to know what is the actual cleansing chemical at work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So before I either abandon this (decidedly serviceable) carafe for a new one, or begin indexing my pantry for candidate chemicals: **How should I clean this stainless carafe?** Surely someone must have had and solved this problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition: I'd also like to ensure that I don't make this worse in the process; e.g., scratching or etching the inside of the carafe.

You might ask to add also some chocolate powder. Apart from the taste, the powder filling the foam pore gives a pleasant look to the drink. When travelling abroad, I see this as a standard feature, but here it is on request.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The steam is produced from a pump part of quite a large coffee machine, which is the  standard equipment of any  Italian bar. Because of the high pressure involved it is normally not possible to produce a cappuccino at home, at least not using a standard stove. Anyway nowadays they are selling cut down versions of the bar machine, which can produce bar-like cappuccinos (and coffee) even at home. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Temperature is crucial for cappuccino. Hot temperature is necessary to produce the foam, but a too hot cappuccino will hurt your tongue. Contrary to a hot cup of tea, where you can wait for it to become  colder, here when the hot goes away also the foam does, so what you drink is not a cappuccino anymore.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Espresso means express, as you might guess. It is a coffee made with the big machine I mentioned above.&#xD;&#xA;Contrary to the coffee made at home on the stove, with the so called moka machine, this machine can make a good coffee instantly. That anyway requires this appliance to be already setup (with proper pressure and temperature levels), which takes time but it is done only once, in the morning, when the bar opens. it might help observing that breakfast is almost inexistent in Italy, as it consists for many of a fast and frugal espresso  or cappuccino with a croissant, taken  standing still at the bar before commuting  to you workplace. So speed in brewing pays.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Besides Italian approach to coffee as a drink is radically different. For what I have seen, in the rest of the world the coffee is drunk in mugs similar to those used for the tea (I am thinking to American coffee for example); here  the size of a coffee cup is extremely small and  this is because the drink is concentrated. To brew the coffee like  this you need water at  high pressure and  high temperature forced  through a  tier of coffee by the coffee machine. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Big espresso machines found in bars are ideal, given their power, to obtain this and generally their output is considered better than moka coffee made at home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that contrary to cappuccino, here the higher the temperature the better the taste. To make it drinkable bars use special cups very thick. The final results is that you don't hurt your lips when you drink, also the volume of liquid  going through your mouth is less, and you don't burn your tongue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have read that the total caffeine in an American coffee is higher, anyway the sensation that you have with an espresso is like you are taking something stronger and we even amplify this effect by drinking it fast, often in one shot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the high temperature and pressure, if one does not make the espresso daily, it is very easy to make it  *burned*, producing something that is  bitter and distasteful. I have seen many  used  to American coffee (big cups), disliking espresso and vice versa. &#xD;&#xA;Anyway, before deciding that the strong taste of espresso is not for you, make sure you have tasted a professionally  made one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I said before, there are now home espresso machines, which are also easy to operate. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Latte is short for latte macchiato, stained milk. The stain is the a little quantity of coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Strange as it may seem, in Italy the word espresso is a sort of foreigner word not used at all. Perhaps it was in 1800, when the espresso was invented, but now we just say: &quot;A coffee, please&quot;.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Each brewing method needs its own grinding of the beans. Espresso machines use a finer grinding than slow (filter) coffee for example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lets assume an espresso machine is being used by the OP. A finer grinding can result in 'channeling'. Channeling means the water creates a single channel trough the coffee puck instead of evenly distributed water flow. The single channel will lose its good taste because of the quantity of water it processes. So the result product aquires all of its taste of that single channel. In a matter of seconds you will be left with bitter coffee. The other effect of finer grinding is a longer exposure to the water, because the water takes longer to reach the bottom of the puck because of the fine grind.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other factors resulting in bitter taste: water quality, bean type, bean freshness and roasting process, tamping (for espresso machines), cleaning of your brewing device, cleaning of your grinder, extraction time, water temperature, and so on. So a lot is involved and a single answer to this broad question cannot be given. Entire books have been written on this topic." />

I end up with a relatively crema-y shot. You'd never mistake it for one from an espresso machine, but there's a good layer all across the top. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is completely unscientific and I can't identify which steps here are the relevant ones for the good results, but maybe if you experiment with some of these adjustments you can identify what works and what doesn't. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Equipment&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Aeropress&#xD;&#xA;* Scoop that came with the Aeropress&#xD;&#xA;* [Ultra fine mesh filter](http://www.amazon.com/Filter-AeroPress-Ultra-Stainless-Coffee/dp/B00A1GVVMY)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Coffee&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The beans I use vary; I generally grab a light or medium roast off the shelves at Trader Joes and grind it one click down from the finest setting on the in-store grinder. (The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's [Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee](http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Jamaica-Mountain-Coffee/dp/B00GK5R8IG), a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says [it's the best bet](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html) for Trader Joe's coffee.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Set up the Aeropress for [inverted brewing](http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/).&#xD;&#xA;2. For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&#xD;&#xA;3. Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a [gooseneck kettle](http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg) for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&#xD;&#xA;4. Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&#xD;&#xA;5. Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&#xD;&#xA;6. Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* My results vary significantly. I *think* the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&#xD;&#xA;* I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit Redux:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I [mentioned below](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress/165#comment772_165), all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and [an app full of AeroPress recipes](http://aeropresstimer.com); thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally. I'll track the results [here](https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0) and update this answer when and if I come up with a reliable way to generate and preserve the foam on my AeroPress shots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit The Third:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The results are in](https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0): I've figured out how to stop killing my crema. It turns out that the combination of **freshly ground beans** and **the mesh paper filter** is somehow stopping the crema from getting through to the cup. Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the plot thickens. My [colleague Robert](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/137/robert-cartaino) asserts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Never had a problem getting crema with aeropress. Lots of fresh coffee ground to a powder, very little very hot water. Makes my ubercoffee syrup shots I talked about a year or more ago... with plenty o crema. Dilute to taste (which I never did &lt; jitter &gt;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...and I'm not entirely sure, but if memory serves, switching to the fine metal mesh filter meant bye-bye to crema. It's been a bit too long to remember for certain. I just reused the same paper filter over and over for months (actually, I used two to keep them from blowing out).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it would seem that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Freshly, very finely ground coffee + paper filter + not much water = crema city&#xD;&#xA;* Coffee ground fine in the store + metal filter + water = crema town&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd be interested to see others' results from experiments like these." />

Your choice, but oxygen whitened filters are usually less expensive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Brown filters are just plain without any improvements.

Trying to save money, get a white one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Speaking of Performance...&#xD;&#xA;In this [website][2],it states that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Natural brown : In its natural form, all paper is brown colored, so brown filters are completely unprocessed. Other than aesthetics and processing, there are no other differences in color.&#xD;&#xA;- White : White paper filters are processed to get that clean, white shade. Chlorine bleaching or natural oxygen bleaching are common methods for whitening paper. Generally, better quality paper ones do not use chlorine bleach.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Avoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though.

I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the [website][3] where all the information of this section came from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Environmental Impacts&#xD;&#xA;Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the [website][4] that provided the paragraph.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;Not a lot of differences that are outright clear, but there are minor differences between the two.

Text="**EDIT:** I thought about this more. In sum, I believe that this question (as asked) is not answerable (but it *is* interesting!). With just about *any* selected brewing method, you'll be able to extract almost all of the caffeine from the beans. However, depending on the method chosen, you need to use different parameters to get full extraction (time, pressure, temperature, etc.). For example: Espresso is certainly the fastest to get full caffeine extraction, but you need a fine grind.  Filter/drip or French press are slower, but espresso-fine grind just won't work correctly; you need to use a coarser grind. Given the same beans, and the right technique for the given method, you can achieve almost 100% caffeine extraction.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an example of drip versus espresso, the [Wikipedia article on caffeine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine) (and the two cited references that include figures on both espresso and drip caffeine content -- [this](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_info1.shtml) and [this](http://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database)) claim nearly the same caffeine content for drip versus espresso; in fact, they list that drip coffee has *slightly more* caffeine than espresso. I can't fully accept these, however, because there's no way to know if they're using arabica or robusta, light roast or dark roast, how much ground coffee was used to brew -- there's just too many unknowns that back those figures. Since arabica, for instance, is ~1% caffeine, with 7g of coffee (&quot;standard dose&quot;, from INEI) you'll be able to get ~70mg caffeine. Those are pretty consistent with the cited figures -- meaning 100% caffeine extraction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you'd have to ask a different question in a different way (e.g., what's the fastest extraction method? or How to get 100% caffeine extraction with cold brew?) or so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I agree with most of @Chris in AK's answer (and +1!), but I wanted to add another take on this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think solubility is a big factor here; caffeine is *very* soluble in hot water -- approaching 66g/100mL (~150g/cup) in boiling water, and even at room temperature nearly 2g/100mL (~5g/cup) ([citation listed at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Chemical_properties) and [here](http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB0202769.htm)). Yes, those are listed as *grams*, which means that water could dissolve *tens to hundreds of times* as much caffeine, as compared to the caffeine dose in an average cup/demitasse of strong coffee or espresso (which contain perhaps ~50mg-200mg per cup; see also questions on caffeine content, such as [this](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup) and [this](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/94/how-much-caffeine-is-in-an-espresso-shot); also keep in mind that the [lethal dose of caffeine](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/469/262) is somewhere in the 10g-20g range.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Back to your actual question, I do agree that you've restricted yourself quite a bit; pressure is one of the few variables you didn't eliminate. To that end: a comparison of extraction of pressure-brewed (e.g., espresso) versus filter/drip follows.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, caffeine is quickly extracted from coffee beans (and tea leaves); most is extracted within 30 seconds of water contact (though this certainly depends on fineness of grind and other factors). Here's a visualization of [extraction of comparison of pressure-brewed and drip versus time](http://www.espressoplanet.com/espresso-coffee-machine/pressure_brewed_coffee_extraction.html), which depicts the quantity of caffeine (and other stuff) extracted over time. I found it amusing that the context of that article is actually advocating for espresso as a way to brew *lower* caffeine content coffee; the point being that the &quot;other stuff&quot; (aroma, colour, flavour) is extracted even more quickly with pressure-brewed (versus drip) coffee.  So, if you extract for only 10 seconds (which is *very* short indeed) you'll get most of the &quot;other stuff&quot; but less caffeine. On the other hand, a finer grind will permit faster extraction of caffeine and everything else; [this article suggests that espresso is higher in caffeine based on the grind factor](http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-espresso-vs-drip); I think there are too many other variables for that conclusion.&#xD;&#xA;" />

According to [their website](http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=880), the National Coffee Association USA has spent $6 million on research funding over the last 20 or so years.  The NCAUSA cites 80 specific investigations that they funded. (I don't know if the trend is up or down over the two decades.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From reading Antony Wild's [Coffee: A Dark History](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/coffee-antony-wild/1112483551?ean=9780393060713) a few years ago, it was my impression that the coffee industry sets great importance on [demonstrable health benefits](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/health/coffee-myth-fact/). See in particular Chapt. 14, Coffee, Science and History.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The book mentions specifically the [Vanderbilt Institute for Coffee Studies](http://vanderbilt.edu/ics/) as funded by &quot;a $6 million grant from the coffee industry&quot; to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 1999.  (In 2007 the Institute moved its affiliation from the Medical Center to the Vanderbilt Center for Latin American Studies, but continues investigating &quot;the health effects of coffee consumption, including potential therapeutic uses&quot;.)  While some of this funding came from NCAUSA, it appears the bulk came from the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), with additional funding by the All Japan Coffee Association and the International Coffee Organization.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The global coffee commodity market has annual sales [well-up in the tens of billions($)](http://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=|||||0901|||4|1|1|2|2|1|2|1|), so I would expect more in annual research funding than the average $300K/yr reported by NCAUSA.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Added:** Apparently it is difficult for coffee trade associations to survive.  The NCAUSA cited above is ancient in comparison to other organizations mentioned.  The Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) [began in 1993](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/business/world-markets-a-new-coffee-cartel-tries-its-hand.html) with a model of OPEC-like price supports through agreed upon limitations of exports, but [dissolved at the beginning of 2002](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1608356.stm).

It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help &quot;wick&quot; the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Contrasting the two types of cones:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;between a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the &quot;wells&quot; from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow &quot;seals&quot; itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for &quot;why&quot; this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the &quot;seal&quot; and permits the coffee to drain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar &quot;ridge&quot; that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little &quot;pleats&quot; in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I find that this &quot;pooling&quot; happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the &quot;sealing,&quot; but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the [Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex) suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wB2fc.jpg" />

If you're not looking for much foam, the differences are probably less profound.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's a few other plant-based milks out there also; coconut and rice weren't mentioned in the other answers. In sum, I know of 5 common plant milks: almond, coconut, hemp, rice, soy.

They got the best performance with almond milk, coconut did almost as well, and rice milk did not perform well.&#xD;&#xA;* MarkBittman dot com has an article on [the search for a vegan cappuccino](http://markbittman.com/the-milk-chronicles-in-search-of-vegan-cappuc/). It suggests that soy is the best alternative for foam, followed by almond. The text and comments suggest (but doesn't outright state) that hemp works well also.&#xD;&#xA;* The [Peaceful Dumpling](http://www.peacefuldumpling.com/top-3-milk-alternatives-baristas-guide) article (linked previously in @PythonMaster's answer; summarizing the original article's conclusions here) concludes that soy is best, followed closely by hemp, and that almond doesn't work as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The conclusions tend to be suggest that cow milk will perform better than plant-based &quot;milks.&quot; This probably suggests that lactose-free milks (i.e., with lactase, like Lactaid and others) will be *your* best bet. Of course, you could always take a lactase pill and enjoy your cup with conventional milk. Various articles suggest that certain soy milks are best, and that coconut, hemp, and almond will also work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's a ton of other factors, but these probably reduce to preference: some milks will be sweetened, or import their own taste (e.g., almond, coconut). Others might have emulsifiers or other additives (such as carrageenan), which impact the steaming (maybe helping or hurting).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another take would be to look at the &quot;science&quot; of what happens during steaming: it's a combination of fats and proteins that are being agitated and changed in the right way to make foam.  [This CoffeeGeek article](http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/milk) discusses frothing and what's at work; this was interesting for me, and might help you pick a milk based on protein and fat content among the various milk options.&#xD;&#xA;" />

To use this device, you put grounds in a basket on the top, water in the bottom, assemble the apparatus, and put it over a heat source (e.g., camp fire, stove, etc.). If you want a stronger brew (as it sounds like you do), you can also use a moka pot (some call this a &quot;stovetop espresso maker&quot;, though I don't care for that term) -- there are some [very **compact moka pots** like this one](http://www.mec.ca/product/5006-001/gsi-stainless-steel-espresso-maker/) that are targeted for backpacking/camping. This will give you very good moka-pot-strong espresso-like coffee, but you won't mistake it for espresso out of a professional espresso machine. You get the full experience of brewing a pot of coffee in the wilderness, which I enjoy. See also my related q/a on [the difference between a percolator and a moka pot](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/418/whats-the-difference-between-a-percolator-and-a-moka-pot). Those are my preferences for camp coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a little more technology, you can use **integrated heater/container systems** like the [JetBoil](http://www.jetboil.com); they also have small accessories like this [French press insert](http://www.jetboil.com/Products/Coffee-Press/) so you can minimize the extra gear (e.g., you can use the setup for heating water for other cooking, *and* (separately) use it to make coffee).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the extreme end of low-weight and low-technology spectrum, you could use [instant coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_coffee) or try [coffee bags such as these](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001M05070), which are like tea bags, except that they are filled with coffee. You could even make your own coffee-bags (see [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Customize-your-own-portable-coffee-bags/) and [MtBoE](http://makethebestofeverything.com/2013/07/diy-coffee-brewing-bags.html)).

These single-serve coffee bags have the advantage of minimal clean-up, and the whole package may be compostable. Also you don't have to worry about hot gear if you're packing up to get on the trail quickly (e.g., backpacking). Bags and instant are passable, ultra-light substitutes for actual coffee that get the job done but are less enjoyable to drink (for me).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Storage of beans and/or grounds is tricky -- [especially already-ground coffee goes stale very quickly](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off). You can minimize the damage by keeping everything sealed and dry.

These flavors usually come from unstable molecules that deteriorate quickly after the coffee is brewed. When coffee is brewed and consumed relatively quickly, the drinker can enjoy those flavors. Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, it you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want. If you hear about another light roasted coffee that has strong sweetness but is more acidic than you usually like, try it as a cold brew. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I.e. if acid is what is holding you back with specific coffees you want to try, try them as a cold brew.** Just know that the lack of acid in the cold brew may make it a little lack-luster compared to a traditional cup, especially since tasting notes are made when evaluating hot brewed cup.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Darker roasted coffee as already lost more of the bean flavors and gained more roast flavors. If anything, I would say that a darker roast is going to have a more consistent flavor between hot and cold brewing simply because more of the delicate flavors have already been burned away. I would bet that Kicking Horse and Blue Bottle suggest a medium roast for cold brew because a medium roast preserves the beans own characteristics while introducing the roast flavors. This is why single origins are usually roasted to full city or less. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**In summary, I would suggest that you find a coffee you like already as a french press or pour over and cold brew that regardless of roast.** Lighter roasts may lose some of their complexity in a cold brew, darker roasts will mellow even more in a cold brew.

Lightly roasted or medium roasted coffee will taste more like the bean it came from, or its origin.  The darker you roast, the more the origin flavors go away and are replaced by the roasting flavors of the bean.  As it so happens, the origin flavors of roasted coffee fade very quickly (sometimes in as short as a week).  However, the roasting flavors seem to hang around a bit longer.  Large chains dark roast their coffee because it makes it easier to consistently produce close to the same taste and the flavor of those dark roasted bean will hang around a bit longer (less shipping and storage concerns).

Green coffee beans prior to roasting generally still have the silverskin intact/attached.  As the bean expands during roasting and the silverskin dries out, it generally comes off.  Part of the roasting process is some sort of agitation and airflow to remove this chaff.  Depending on the roast level and other mechanical factors, more or less of the silverskin may be removed.  On lighter roasted coffee with less expansion you can often see bits of silverskin along the seam on the bean.  Some processing methods prior to roasting also remove less of the silverskin, &quot;dry processed&quot; coffee in particular tends to be more chaffy when roasting and may require a longer time agitating or smaller roast batches to remove chaff.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many of my lighter roasts end up with a bit more chaff than I'd like.

You need to try to finish your roast at a level or so lighter than what you are aiming for and let the coffee &quot;cool&quot; into your desired roast.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I might suggest that you roast at a lower level (lower heat) so that the beans move through the stages more slowly.  This will badly suck up your time, but will also allow you greater chance of stopping the roast at the roast level you are aiming for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that many of the descriptions you read for green coffee are done by people with extremely refined palates.  No matter what coffee you roast, those fruit type descriptions are still hints and notes in the coffee, not it's overall flavor.  Additionally the quality of the green beans you are roasting will affect the final quality of your roast.  It's impossible to make poor green beans great by perfectly roasting them.  You can, however, ruin high quality green beans with a poor roast.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When I started roasting, I was &quot;lucky&quot; enough to start with a cheap air popper.  The advantage of that is that with a popper it is very easy to hear the &quot;cracks&quot; associated with roasting.  My personal opinion is that the &quot;cracks&quot; are one of the few constants with beans that actually consistently indicate roast level.  While there are other gauges out there (darkness and smell) they can vary with different varieties of beans.  Eventually I moved to a machine where I couldn't hear the cracking at all, but by then, I had learned enough of the other queues that it didn't matter as much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.sweetmarias.com/freshroast_detail.php" />

By preheating your roaster, you should be able to get more consistent roast times.  In my case my garage is sometimes 50F and sometimes 80F, so a preheat cycle would certainly probably help.  I don't do it though.  Any machine has a finite number of cycles, and you are shorting that window by preheating your machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I roast one and a half pounds a week (a half pound for work, and one pound for home).  The half pound is always done by itself from a cold start.  When I do the pound for home, I do two half pound batches, the first is from a cold start and the second is done immediately following on a &quot;preheated&quot; machine.  I try to aim for the same roast level on each of the batches and the second one consistently needs less time to reach the same level.  I generally set a timer and come back 14 minutes after the start.  This allows me to fine tune the last portion of the batch, on cold batches I generally add a bit of time, and on the preheated ones I end up subtracting a bit (to get the same roast).  I am fine with this as it saves me a cycle and will prolong the life of my roaster.  However, I can see that some folks would want the roast length of two such batches to be much closer to the same at the cost of that extra cycle.  For them it may make sense." />

I read on a roaster's site (I'll try to find the reference) that acidic flavors come out first, sweet compounds second, and bitter flavors last when brewing.  The trick is to stop the extraction before you get the bitter flavors.  Hotter water and finer grounds will extract faster.  Darker roasts will tend to be more harshly flavored than lighter roasts and a fine ground dark bean with very hot water might be undrinkable.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would definitely experiment with your coffee.  200F water is a bit on the hot side, 190-195 is a more common recommendation.  With that temperature, start with 30 seconds, next try 1 minute and so on until you find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; so to speak.  There will definitely be a difference in the taste.  The World Aeropress Championships site is a good start but modifying their methods to suit your taste is easy with an AeroPress.  I see you're already using the inverted method which will very definitely allow you to vary the timing.  Good luck!" />

Some things you're removing may be more soluble at higher temperatures. I wouldn't go to the trouble of heating pre-filtered water. there is something to be said for water temperature affecting the filtering qualities of the paper by expanding the fibers, and in turn spaces between fibers. But without testing we'll have to assume it's a minor. If you only have cold filtered water, I suggest you use that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why not hot water? First, a quick rinse of hot water isn't going to neutralize significantly more micro organisms that cold. You need boiling or much higher for a length of time to do that. Second, hot water will make the filter more prone to breaking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I have brewed simultaneous batches with rinsed and non-rinsed; I taste exactly no difference&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This leads me to think that soaking is worth a try.

Espresso is a very specific brewing method that produces a very specific type of coffee.  Trying to mimic that flavor profile with other brew methods will generally fall short.  Using more coffee for stronger flavor is one option, but it ends up not being cost effective in the long run.  More extraction is an option, but over extracted coffee often has a flavor profile associated with it that isn't desirable as well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The closest you can get (in my opinion) on a budget is probably an Aeropress.  It is fairly inexpensive and makes a very strong cup of coffee using a reasonable amount of grounds that isn't espresso, but also isn't over extracted.  The downside is that it's difficult to generate crema with such a brew method.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might be forced to figure out which aspects of the long black you like, then come up with a brew method that gets you close on those aspects, but is probably missing others that make up the true long black.

This leads to the building of interesting dust-like coffee residuals. While this started out of mere laziness, I meanwhile deliberately refrain from washing it as the result is visually quite appealing and an interesting long-term endeavour to see how that coffee cup evolves over the years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am however wondering **if those residuals actually have any kind of influence on the fresh coffee drank from this cup**. Now of course there isn't anything moulding, it's an entirely dry thin dust layer, and I don't really make out any taste difference to a clean cup (as the coffee isn't too much of a high quality product in the first place and I'm not a big tasting expert either). So this might be a stupid question. But for example I heard somewhere (though, that's entirely anecdotal hearsay, too) that you shouldn't wash a tea can with dishwasher but only with water because of some flavoury reasons. So maybe there is actual proper or even scientifically grounded reasoning that the **dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have any kind of influence on the coffee drinking experience, however small and imperceptible, be that flavour-wise or regarding other effects, advantageous or defective**." />

It has only really the drawback of using an additional sum of coffee and filter.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would not recommend using the 3rd method.  At that point you are just headed to over extracted grounds and a less desirable (by most people) cup of coffee.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To sum up, you are looking at producing a cup sized quantity of good coffee with method one, a cup sized quantity of Aerpresso with the second and a cup sized quantity of likely over extracted coffee with method three.

This suggests a multi-step process of pouring.

Shake out dried coffee and rinse; repeat as necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Commentary: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* This permits really only 3 steps of brewing: boil, mix, press. This is about as simple as possible. By grinding after boiling, this minimizes the amount of time between grind and brew (crucial minutes!) and minimizes the overhead of manual interaction.&#xD;&#xA;* By using the multi-step clean-up process that I describe, this maximizes efficiency: get most of the coffee out by shaking when still wet (just brewed). Allow to dry on its own, and the rest of the coffee grounds will come out easily. A simple rinse is enough to get most of the remnants out without clogging a sink drain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Long live manual coffee production methods!  See other guides from [Coffee Geek](http://coffeegeek.com/guides/presspot), [Blue Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/french-press), and [How To Brew Coffee](http://www.howtobrewcoffee.com/French.htm) -- I prefer a simpler approach that I describe than all of those.&#xD;&#xA;" />

The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Secondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.

To avoid waste, I only brew as much as I need, so I usually drink it all.  In order to further reduce waste, I have tried metallic net filters instead of paper filters, but they tend to allow an ultra fine silt to pass through, the presence of which at the bottom of the cup is annoying if the plan is to drink all the coffee.  So, I started doing this: first I place a paper filter in the coffee maker, to collect the ultra fine silt, which is actually very small in volume, and inside the paper filter I place the metallic net filter to collect the actual coffee grounds, which are 99% of the volume. Then, I brew my coffee.  When it is time to make more coffee, I only remove and wash the metallic net filter; the paper filter stays in its place, and gets reused about five times before it has collected so much ultra-fine silt that it is time to replace it.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do you see anything seriously wrong with this technique?  Does it perhaps have any side effects that I should be aware of?  Would such a practice be considered yucky by some?  (If it is, then this is a cultural issue that perhaps I should be aware of.)  Obviously, the coffee smells and tastes fine to me, but I have to wonder whether noses and palates that are more sensitive than mine think otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know, it says &quot;we prefer questions that can be answered, not just discussed&quot;, so if you have something to say, please just state it without starting a long discussion about it!

I tried to quit cold-turkey once, and spent two weeks mostly bouncing a rubber ball off the wall of my dorm room before I decided the addiction itself wasn't even that bad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Eventually I needed to do something about it, and I went with the only logical method: I **slowly** backed down my consumption, from about five to seven cups per day at the time to a hard limit of two.

As soon as it is brewed its flavor begins to degrade and deteriorate, which is why it always tastes much better freshly brewed.  While you may not necessarily taste the difference from one pot to the next, it has definitely changed your overall expectation of the flavor.  The bouquet of coffee also is very complex, as is obvious from the fact that there is a distinct change in the scent from the time you grind to the time the brewing stops.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One flavor issue with reusing paper filters is that they tend to stop a large amount of the oils in the coffee from making it into the final product.  This could be desirable, as many (myself included) prefer the taste of paper-filtered coffee that does not contain the compounds found in the crema (the thin layer of foam on top of espresso, Turkish or French-press coffee).  These, which are often a combination of both sweet and bitter, are trapped by paper filters, but they will break down in the paper over multiple uses and wash into your coffee anyway, but not necessarily in the same form, which further changes the flavor profile.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If waste is a major concern, but you prefer paper-filtered coffee, you can make a compromise and use an Aeropress.  These use filters that are only about 2 inches in total diameter, meaning less gets tossed with each brew.  You could also look into filters made with recycled paper.  It won't reduce the waste, but it will reduce the environmental impact somewhat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember, though, that in the end paper filters are biodegradable and, if thrown away along with the grounds, can actually aid in creation of compost -- a good thing." />

If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso. But this suggests **you might want to change other parameters of your brewing**. If you can re-brew your coffee with a result that you like, you might be able to, for example, use less grounds. This saves money, which sounds like it's part of your goal. Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see [this Q/A for what I mean by extraction](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean) in this case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could **try this experimentally** also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way. For example, I find the last few drops of pour-over brew to be watery and off-tasting but the entire batch tastes better together than either of the two parts separately. If you like it, go for it. Or use half the amount of grounds the next time. :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a practical note, you might also consider simply to **brew a larger batch of coffee all in one go**. You'll get a slightly different product but, for example, I find that I use way less grounds for a 10-cup thermal carafe than for 10 individual cups." />

This answer is based on internet research and professional experience.  This answer addresses some of the product design challenges and less of the real engineering challenges, but a lead into the engineering challenges. Based on the question and comment I believe OP is interested in designing a coffee maker.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From a business standpoint most organizations strive to service segments of the market that organizations believe they have a competitive advantage. These organizations also try to offer products to meet opening (OPP), mid (MPP) and High (HPP) price points. Also branding place a significant part in product pricing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assumption: US dollar = Euro (Approximately, 1 Euro = 1.09 US$) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Coffee Maker Product Landscape**  &#xD;&#xA;Based on the above I did some research on [food services warehouse][1] and selected Grindmaster for this analysis. Base on list price following are the price point classification (Dollars $)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - OPP: 1000 - 2600&#xD;&#xA; - MPP: 3500 - 4700&#xD;&#xA; - HPP: 6000 - 10,000&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Below is a table for OPP, MPP, and HPP price segmentation (April 6th, 2015)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Price segmentation][2]][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lets assume the following as customer segments&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - OPP: Small office break room coffee machine&#xD;&#xA; - MPP: Large office cafeteria&#xD;&#xA; - HPP: High traffic coffee shop, Panera, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts…&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**Requirements Analysis:**  &#xD;&#xA;Flow rate was chosen to keep the analysis simple&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - OPP:  4 - 15 gl/hr&#xD;&#xA; - MPP: 15 - 32 gl/hr&#xD;&#xA; - HPP:  32 - 50 gl/hr&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Engineering Analysis**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Product Design**  &#xD;&#xA;Consider the Motor (Rotor, Stator, Casting) or the heating element from the BOM. Each of the price points (PP) most like need a different type of component. The component price to meet the above flow rate specification can be significantly different. Also the product volume is each PP is different thus for HPP or even MPP product it is highly unlikely to obtain volume base pricing that OPP might enjoy. Thus explains the cost of components.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Example BOM for  coffee Maker][3]][11]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Product Testing, Validation and Manufacturing**   &#xD;&#xA;The cost of testing, validation and manufacturing will be much higher for MPP and HPP product because the consumer demands for higher quality product compared to OPP products.  Thus the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost per machine will much higher for MPP and HPP product than the OPP products.&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;**Product Serviceability and Support**  &#xD;&#xA;An OPP price point product needs very little from a serviceability and after sale support compared to MPP or HPP product. An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance. Also consider a customer like Starbuck or Panera, they demand for high quality, and zero downtime. Therefore the components used in MPP or HPP coffee makers of significantly higher quality than the OPP coffee makers.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Product Pricing VS BOM price -&gt; General rule of thumb is BOM cost is 1/5 the Product Price. I believe this is a good starting point to figure what take to compete in the intended the coffee maker market. It appears that the coffee maker market is a red ocean. Therefore it important identify the point of differentiation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**References:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Blue Ocean Strategy][4] &#xD;&#xA; - [Example Coffee Maker BOM][5]&#xD;&#xA; - [Example Coffee Maker Landscape][6]&#xD;&#xA; - [Performance Improvement Analysis][7]&#xD;&#xA; - [Coffee Maker Product Design][8]&#xD;&#xA; - [Grindmaster Single brew coffee maker product offering example][9]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.foodservicewarehouse.com&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxCvm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxCv.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImtm.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImt.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.jsedimensions.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Meo-Figure-1.png&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.jsedimensions.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Meo-Figure-3.png&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.jsedimensions.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Meo-Figure-2.png&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://wiki.ece.cmu.edu/ddl/index.php/Coffeemaker&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.foodservicewarehouse.com/commercial-coffee-makers-grindmaster-single-brew/c3414_1696-215_1704-619.aspx" />

But with a blade grinder, grind it longer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) This is the biggest: *don't use boiling water*. Optimal coffee extraction occurs at temperatures roughly between 185 and 202 degrees F.  You'll need to play with this, because the actual best temperature varies with things like water quality, altitude and, yes, weather.  Those last two are the same reason why recipes often have special steps or settings for high-altitude prep.  I find that, in North Carolina, the best temperature is on the higher end of that range, from 195 to 200 degrees.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4) Finally, don't stir with a metal spoon during extraction.  Metal is a heat sink and will alter the temperature of the water.  Additionally (this is speculation, as I don't have verification for this), the fact that many coffees are at least mildly acidic can also result in flavor changes with a metal spoon if you stir before adding cream.  The cream is basic and will help neutralize the acid." />

I've read a number of reviews. It's been hard to find blind tastings by coffee experts. Basically, it doesn't seem like anything special. If anything, it kind of tastes bad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, there may be more to the story. Indonesians I know have offered two explanations for why I was unimpressed. And these excuses were not mutually exclusive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One is a lack of certification -- that is, how do you know you were drinking real Kopi Luwak? Hah! Maybe somebody's faking you out!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other excuse is that, even when it's &quot;real&quot;, it might be factory farmed. This excuse is based on the observation (true) that Kopi Luwak used to be produced entirely from excreta by Luwak in the wild, who (according to this story) would eat only the best coffee cherries, often from the best coffee estates. These days, lamentably, most Kopi Luwak is produced by shoveling lots of possibly-mediocre coffee cherries into Luwak pens, then raking up what they crap out. Between (1) the stressed condition of these captive animals, (2) a coffee-cherry-only diet (not very balanced), (3) the lower quality of the coffee they are fed, and perhaps (4) slipshod processing by opportunists who don't really know coffee, Kopi Luwak coffee quality has taken a dive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Or so /that/ excuse goes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was suprised to find that Kopi Luwak in Indonesia is not really dramatically more expensive. Maybe 30% more than anything comparable, when I was there last year. That margin might be narrowing. The cachet of Kopi Luwak being &quot;the world's rarest coffee&quot; apparently become a selling point in Indonesia, but since the barriers to market entry are low (especially since verification is virtually non-existent), Indonesia is probably approaching an oversupply situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At best, if you can identify Real Kopi Luwak, there might be something slightly more appealing about it compared to beans from the same estate that were not, erm, &quot;processed&quot; by some wild Luwak &quot;cherry-picking&quot; the best beans. More likely, though, no matter what you try, it will just taste how it tasted to me wherever I went: like something pooped out of some poor animal that was suffering from a serious caffeine addiction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

What I had was single-source, but that's rarer - farms doing it _correctly_ don't produce a lot, so packagers and marketers will usually buy from dozens. That brings me to the first thing that determines the taste of it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###The Roast&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some farmers roast themselves, others just sell the beans. Many sell directly to people _and_ to packagers, so unless you get it single-source, you're probably going to have a bag of beans roasted anywhere from blonde to nearly dark. If you're serious about tasting it, find a place that offers single-source, or roasts their own. You want it _just at_ the second 'crack'. A comparable color is a Starbucks 'blonde' roast, or the usual color of illy in the red can.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###The Brew&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've had it two ways, as espresso and in a press. I _prefer_ to have it in a press, despite not getting nearly as much crema. A coarse grind, hot clean water and about 4 minutes to brew. ***Drink it immediately with a clean palette***. Make sure you're not thirsty, make sure you're not hungry, and make sure there's nothing going on with your taste buds other than the coffee. You want to sip slow and enjoy it. Don't let it get cold, but slow down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###The Taste&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While debates are quite hot regarding whether or not the civet's digestion of the bean adds anything to flavor, I'm quite confident that the selection process _does_. Good Arabica coffee is known for the subtle nutty / caramel hints, and you know it when you drink this. I couldn't detect any difference in acidity, but the flavors that the bean is known are definitely more present than usual. This makes a lot of sense given the selection process, civets are _very_ picky cats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, that's not to say that a very discriminating and trained picker couldn't get you something close. In fact, illy (red) comes _very_ close to the same quality and presence of flavor undertones that I've experienced with alamid (kopi luwak).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't raise your expectations _too_ high, it's not really _that_ much better than any other very high quality Arabica. You're paying for the process (make sure you're dealing with an 'honest' source) as much as you are the quality of bean, novelty and experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It tastes very good, but so do the illy beans I grind every day. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

That isn't to say that the NFC's work doesn't ensure high standards for Colombian exports, but it isn't favorable to some sectors of the coffee market who prize distinct coffee from a single origin. &#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.sweetmarias.com/library/content/colombia-0&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/71rka.jpg" />

No matter how long or short the grind, there is extreme heterogeneity in particle size--that is, you will find larger bean fragments with near-dust-size ones, with everything in between.  If you use a pour-over or drip brewing method, you might even see whole beans floating to the top.

Sometimes each type can use a different filter. I will provide a non-exhaustive list of filter types for these coffee makers which you have listed. Although the list in non-exhaustive, it will provide the main types of filters for each device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Understanding Permanent versus Paper filters&#xD;&#xA;---------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A permanent filter is often made out of metal and is, in most cases, a mesh (not true for espresso machines). They are not disposable and are made to be reused many times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An impermanent filter is generally made out of paper and is disposable and is generally not meant to be reused.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Drip Coffee&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Drip Coffee machines are one of the most common coffee machines for home use. The filter used will either be paper or permanent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A paper filter for the drip coffee machine will either be flat-bottom or cone-shaped depending on the make and model of the coffee machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Flat-bottom filters:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Flat-bottom Filter][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Cone shaped filter:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Cone shaped filter][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The permanent filter can take the same shapes, however it is generally a flat-bottom shape yet can be a hybrid between a cone shaped and a flat-bottom shaped filter. I can only describe this as an upside down triangular prism. Below is a picture of the aforementioned hybrid filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Hybrid cone filter][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Single Cup &#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These filters are generally made out of paper and are usually a cone shape which is usually specific/unique to the type of single cup brewing device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;French (Push) Press&#xD;&#xA;--------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A french or push uses a permanent filter which is made out of a fine metal mesh. It is on the bottom of the plunger. The entire bottom of the filter has three main parts, shown below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The Parts of a French Press Filter:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![French Press Filter Parts][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Espresso Machine&#xD;&#xA;----------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An espresso machine's filter is called a portafilter. It shaped like a small basket, made out of metal, and has small holes in the metal on the bottom. There are three sizes. The most common are the single and double shot filters and a rarer one is the triple shot filter. They increase in size to hold more ground coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are generally three types of portafilters in circulation with mainstream home espresso machines.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Single wall. This is the most common in the industrial setting. It is contains only one wall on the bottom of the filter.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Double wall. Think about this as a portafilter for the inexperienced and is most common for the home espresso machine. It has a secondary wall on the bottom of the portafilter with only a few holes in it. The presence of two walls helps to regulate extraction pressure and is therefore good for those who are not very good at tamping pressure and grind size.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Pod filter. This is simply a specially designed filter that is the same shape as the others and comes with some home espresso machines. They are used to hold pre-made and pre-packaged espresso pods that one simply drops into the filter and can avoid many of the other steps of traditional espresso brewing such as tamping and grinding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Portafilters (single wall) on left and baskets (which hold them and are upside down) on the right:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Portafilters][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The filter on the left is a single shot and the filter on the right is a double shot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ntWce.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/CvRrn.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xrAHF.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZeKtK.jpg" />

Often this is compensated for by doubling the strength of the hot brew and letting the ice dilute to normal strength&#xA; - Supposedly (although I've never tried it), the Japanese iced coffee method is a middle ground between iced and cold brewed coffees. In this method, hot coffee is brewed directly over ice instantly cooling it locking in the full flavor of hot coffee, but oxidizing much less. &#xA;&#xA;Often it comes down to taste what in particular might work to make your iced coffee better. A different bean type or roast level, maybe on that is slightly less acidic or more bold may give you the flavor you are looking for. &#xA;&#xA;" />

The ceramic is nonporous and I've used mine for 6 months with no residue or stains whatsoever. The plastic can form build ups from minerals in water or coffee and start to appear visually unappealing (not sure if it will affect flavor of coffee)&#xA;&#xA;The plastic V60 is obviously more durable and resistant to bumps and minor drops, so it can be a portable solution for coffee. However the ceramic V60 is the most visually appealing of the V60's (in my opinion) and it stays at my home on the counter so I prefer it.

The motor in the pump in your Keurig machine may simply just be getting worn out. If this is the problem, you should be able to hear it struggling to pump water out through the K-Cup. If you need a comparison, try comparing it to a newer model and see how it sounds. If de-scaling (see next problem) does not work, then you may need to replace the motor/pump. It may just be easier at that point to buy a new Keurig machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. The machine seriously needs to be de-scaled. I would recommend running a solution of 25% lemon juice and 75% water through the machine. Make sure to run around 250 - 500 mL (about one to two cups) of this solution from the tank all the way through to a cup. Then rinse with atleast 1 L of of normal water (about 4 cups).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***CAUTION:*** &#xD;&#xA;---------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I have stated in other answers, breathing the fumes from this can be extremely dangerous for your mucosa (parts of the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, respiratory tract, and lungs). Do not breathe in the steam or fumes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is not a huge concern with lemon juice (which is why I recommend it), but if you were to use vinegar or a commercial de-scaler, this would be a huge concern. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just be smart about it. You don't want to end up with permanent damage to your respiratory tract.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Other possible problems (harder to fix):**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It could be possible that a seal somewhere in the pump has worn out and air is entering the system as it is being pumped. This would involve replacing a seal and taking the machine apart though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There may be some other component, that I can't think of, that is damaged.

The first is why oil and water don't mix. The second is why oil rises, as opposed to sinking or staying in place. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First question. There is an old saying in chemistry that like dissolves like. What this means is that a substance tends to dissolve in another substance if the molecules of the 2 substances have similar electric dipole moments. Think of an electric dipole like you think of a magnet. The magnet has a north and south pole, and south end of one magnet is attracted to the north end of another magnet, and vice versa. The electric dipole has a positively charged end and a negatively charged end. The magnitude of the positive charge can be greater than that of the negative charge, or vice versa. The difference between the magnitudes of the 2 charges and the distance between them determines the moment or strength of the dipole. In general, dipoles with similar strengths dissolve in each other more readily than dipoles with very different strengths. Oil (as in hydrocarbon-based oils) and water have very different dipole moments, so oil and water do not readily dissolve in each other. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second part of the answer has to do with a force called the buoyancy force. This is the force that causes some objects to float in water. Suppose you want to dissolve 1 cubic cm of oil in water. For this to happen, the oil has to displace 1 cubic cm of water. The buoyancy force on the oil is equal to the weight of that 1 cubic cm of water. Oil is less dense than water, so 1 cubic cm of oil weighs less than 1 cubic cm of water. Therefore, the upward buoyancy force on the oil, which is equal to the weight of water displaced, is greater than the downward force of gravity on the oil, also known as the weight of the oil. This inequality of forces causes the oil to rise in the water. If the oil were denser than the water, the oil's weight (the downward force) would exceed the buoyancy force (the upward force), and the oil would sink in the water." />

I usually recommend a spinning blade grinder to the home barista for this reason.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Evaluating Your Grinds&#xD;&#xA;------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You indicated that you will be using a drip machine with a paper filter. In my opinion, based on what I can see in the picture where the machine has been broken in, ***I* think that these grinds are fine for a paper filter drip machine.** There are a decent number of fine grinds, but I think it's alright for your purposes. If you plan to use another type of machine though, it may not be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you were using an espresso machine or a french press, you would have problems here (which I will not get into here). This might even be true for a permanent filter drip machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My Assessment&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you know that you are only going to use this for paper filter drip coffee, keep it. It seems to be pretty good for this purpose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ever want to branch out into espresso or french press coffee, I recommend returning it and getting either a better one or a spinning blade grinder (which tends to produce more uniformly sized grinds - as long as you buy a medium quality device).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Final Notes&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember it all comes down to you and taste. If you are satisfied with the taste of the coffee, then be happy with your grinder. If you aren't, or want to get as close to perfection as possible, then consider something else." />

In contrast, cold-brew is using cold water in contact with the grounds. See techniques at other questions tagged as [tag:cold-brew].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This article from Counter Culture](https://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/iced-coffee), also referenced in the article you linked, suggest Japanese iced as an *alternative* to cold brew. The articles suggest that directly brewing hot coffee over ice retains more of the volatile flavour compounds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have had true cold-brew before, most methods use *several times* as much coffee grounds to brew as with other methods (some then dilute this with, e.g., water or milk). For example, normalized to a 200mL &quot;cup&quot; (~6.5 fl.oz.) of brewed coffee: Blue Bottle suggests about 3x more coffee for [cold brew](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew) (45g per 200mL) than for [drip](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip) (14g per 200mL). If you're coming from that strength, it's no wonder you're finding it watery. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To your first question: If you want a stronger brew, why not **simply use more coffee grounds**? Your amount (21g grounds to 300g water+ice is about 14g/200mL cup) is already at the higher end of the spectrum for drip coffee; the industry standard is closer to 7g per cup/dose. But if you want it stronger, use more beans!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On your other question: **this temperature change shouldn't be an issue.** You said you're using a Chemex (e.g., [classic 3-cup](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/three-cup-classic-series-coffeemaker.html)) -- it is made from Pyrex brand [borosilicate glass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borosilicate_glass), which has very good thermal shock properties. Even a lesser glass (e.g., non-tempered [soda-lime glass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda-lime_glass)) shouldn't be a problem at these temperatures (slowly dripping boiling water onto ice).

Don't get me wrong, I feel its important, but I don't think it does all the things that people claim it does. Blooming is important when using fresh roasted beans(and you should be). Blooming simply aids in removing CO2 from the grounds, which would otherwise create negative space between your grounds and the water. It's simply used to provide a more even extraction. Blooming is important in any immersion brewing, and can even aid in pour-over methods as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should also reduce your brew time slightly to compensate for the extraction that takes place during the bloom. I'd typically bloom for 30 seconds, then push the bloom down gently without agitation(agitation effect solubility).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think its a dubious claim to state that the bloom does anything beyond removing the CO2, thus providing a more even extraction. It would really depend on how you perform your bloom. Do you bloom then start your timer? Do you bloom with a small amount of water first, then add more to prevent too much extraction during the bloom? Ultimately these differences in taste don't have anything to do with the bloom itself, but more so the extraction time brought on by how you perform your bloom.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bloom itself does not effect taste, and it is an important part of using a french press, as its key to providing even extraction." />

You should have a grind the size of kosher salt for most drippers. Perhaps its personal taste, and I cannot argue that. However, it's typically recommended you start with this grind size and adjust to your preference. As far as my own experience both working as a barista for a few years, and being a over all enthusiast, most grinders don't provide consistent grinds at a coarser settings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;People are right in saying that most home appliance grinders won't produce very consistent grinds. This is partially true. Your typical consumer grade grinder uses a conical burr, and conical burrs work great for finer grinds. I've had 3 different conical grinders, and I've used commercial conical grinders in the past. They all seem to produce fairly inconsistent grinds for coarser settings. However, they work great in espresso machines, which are generally grinding to a very fine grind. When using flat burr grinders I notice a much better consistency in grind at coarser settings. Many will say that the larger the burr and the slower the grind the better consistency you will have. However, I've never experimented with this myself, but I will say that flat burr grinders produce much better coarser grinds than conical burrs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An example of a flat burr grinder is one that you would see at a grocery store or a coffee shop. They are generally very expensive, as they're generally fairly large and aimed at commercial use. That said the Baratza Virtuoso is a conical burr grinder, and it's probably good at what just about any conical burr grinder is good at, medium to fine grinds. I will say that one drawback with flat burr grinders is that they're very slow and create massive amounts of heat on fine grinds(espresso/turkish).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd say a conical burr is good for anything near the coarseness of salt and finer, anything beyond that would be best ground in a flat burr grinder. As far as a flat burr grinder, I feel its the size that matters. You'll want a larger disc for more consistency. Its my assumption that with a larger disc a slower speed will grind the coffee slower and more evenly, causing less of the grounds to crack and mash into finer particles while grinding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of this is based off of my own observations, there are a few forums which concur with this, but in general there's not much else to support these claims. Maybe the flat burr grinders I used were simply higher quality than most of the conical burr grinders I've used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My recommendation would be to try a finer grind and see if you get better consistency then.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as a blade grinder goes, I'd say absolutely not. I doubt that a blade grinder would ever be more consistent than what you currently have. You can use a blade grinder 100 times and never come out with the same grind size, where as with a cheap burr grinder you'll alway have the same grind even if its not consistent. Even as far as consistency goes, a blade grinder won't achieve this either. I might(maybe..) recommend a blade grinder if you had an auto-dripper, where it wouldn't matter so much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Try a finer grind, and let me know if the consistency gets any better." />

Personally this sounds like it would amount to gut rot, however if you try some lighter roasts or preferably profile roasted beans from areas in Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, they tend to have very wine like qualities. Single origin, profile roasted beans typically have very renounced flavors, and profile roasting typically roasts the bean lighter preserving the tannicy, floral, and somewhat wine like qualities in the bean.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It might be prefered to eat the cheese with a cold coffee. If you cold brew coffee it tends to bring out the wine like qualities more so than hot brewing. A common method for this is often called &quot;dutch coffee&quot;, where cold/iced water slowly drips over grounds into a vessel over a long period of time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as dunking the cheese in the coffee. I'm not so sure about this. I mean there are a lot of cheese out there. As far as anything salty with coffee, I generally think the tastes conflict. Personally I don't dunk anything in my coffee, and when it comes to wine &amp; cheese tasting you don't dunk the cheese in the wine. Perhaps a light cheese that isn't salty would work well dipped in coffee. I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of a soft cheese, but a soft cheese itself wouldn't be easily dunked into coffee. You could try spreading Mascarpone on a biscotti and dipping that. Even a porous cheese is unlikely to absorb and carry the taste of coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cheese and coffee aren't exactly a pair made in heaven, but I can see it working much like you said, like wine and cheese. However dunking the cheese in the coffee gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Like I said there are some soft cheeses(usually those used in desserts) that I could imagine being dunked in coffee in some manner, but this is more like a dessert with coffee, which makes me think of a traditional italian 4 course meal which usually ends with the &quot;dolce&quot; or dessert which is often accompanied by espresso. Italy typically also uses soft cheeses in their desserts. Tiramisu, which is very well known, is actually a combination of cheese and coffee. However, like I stated the food and the coffee typically remain separate, unless the coffee is an ingredient in the food.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think what you're trying to do is interesting, but I'd avoid making your wife a test subject. I'd recommend keeping the coffee and cheese separate. However, they can absolutely be consumed in the same sitting, but I don't imagine the actual tastes meld together well in the same mouthful. If she wants something to dip in her coffee, biscotti is a common choice, and if she wants cheese, try spreading some mascarpone on it. You can have fun with different biscotti variants and fold things like chocolate, fruits, etc into the mascarpone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I come from the renowned cheese state Wisconsin, and I've been a long time coffee enthusiast. This title definitely struck interest." />

Stumptown illustrates a similar method.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot.

Starting from the top...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Taste?** Coffee cherries are mild in flavour and slightly sweet. The flavour is somewhat reminiscent of other red fruits, like a mild mix of fruits like raspberry, red mulberry, currant, cranberry, cherry, raisin. I've only had them dried, so they have a little bit of a &quot;dried fruit&quot; taste (e.g., as raisins are to grapes). To me, they also have a little bit of a mild taste of tobacco leaf. When steeped in water to make a drink called [*cascara* (see this question/answers)](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/451/yemenite-tea-like-coffee). The beverage tastes to me a bit like rooibos (red bush tisane). Some coffee shops sell the beverage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Shipping?** I've only seen *dried* coffee cherries for sale. Perhaps &quot;fresh&quot; coffee fruits are available in the coffee belt, but the seeds (i.e., coffee beans) are so valuable that I think the whole fruit doesn't make it very far outside of production regions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Availability?** Various specialty retailers sell the dried fruit pulp and skins (some call them the &quot;husks&quot;) -- here's [one example from Verve](http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea). Searching for coffee berries, cherries, husks, or for beverages like *cascara* or *qishr* may reveal more outlets.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Other preservation?** Coffee skins/pulp dry well. Rehydrating is possible but underwhelming. I have tried to make a kind of marmalade out of them; see [this seminal question](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1508/what-variety-of-coffee-berries-are-good-for-jam), and also [a follow-up question of mine at Seasoned Advice](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/54942/how-should-i-make-jam-out-of-coffee-cherries-or-coffee-cherry-husks). I'm sorry to report that I have not had much success yet. The dried cherries are tough, so not pleasant to eat outright.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good ideas! I really like the stuff, and am always happy to find others, and would be happy to hear more ideas about how to eat and drink coffee cherries.&#xD;&#xA;" />

To fully calibrate the setup, we'll need to make three passes over all the controls. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Frob. In the *frob* pass, we make just &quot;coarse&quot; adjustments to get everything roughly correct.  &#xD;&#xA;2. Twiddle. In the *twiddle* pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more &quot;scientific&quot; manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as &quot;controls&quot; for the quick little &quot;experiments&quot; to check each change.  &#xD;&#xA;3. Tweak. In the *tweak* pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The controls we have available are the **grind**, **dose**, and **water quantity**. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be *constant*. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting &quot;clicks&quot; of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to &quot;full&quot;, maybe a little heaping. This number is your *base* dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the &quot;frob&quot; of the dose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the &quot;frob&quot; of the water quantity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the extraction time was long, adjust the grind. This the &quot;frob&quot; of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, we've done our &quot;frob&quot; pass. Now &quot;twiddle.&quot; Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to &quot;twiddle&quot; per se: there's no *up and down&quot; here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its &quot;range&quot;, if you know what I mean. All the grinds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grinds resist going stale a little more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There should be no need to &quot;twiddle&quot; the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, one final pass to &quot;tweak&quot;. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white &quot;overextraction stain&quot; where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop *just before* the color changes. This tweak gives you &quot;ristretto-quality&quot; shots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Adjusting on-the-fly&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is &quot;comfortable&quot;. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to &quot;ride the wave&quot; of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same three adjustments, **frob**, **twiddle**, and **tweak**, apply also to dynamic adjustments. **Frob**, the *coarsest* control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. **Twiddle**, the *medium-grain* control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. **Tweak**, the *finest* control is the dose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a shot pulls 1-second too long, **tweak** your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a shot pulls 1-second too short, **tweak** your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), **twiddle** the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same *density* with more *mass*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), **twiddle** the grind a little finer so you can achieve the *density* with less *mass*.

If you eat some oatmeal and don't rinse the bowl right away, what happens? You know what happens! It gets hard. It becomes a crust. The same thing happens inside the machine. You need to run a cleaning cycle. For reals, dog.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Calibrating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm assuming you don't have access to the real programming mode. So the control here are very, very limited. You can adjust the grind, rinse, and pull shots with one of several programmed buttons. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each programed button maintains a log of the parameters and measurements of the last few shots upon which it performs some simple statistical analysis to determine when to print &quot;adjust grind coarser&quot; or &quot;adjust grind finer&quot; on the screen. So, the machine only &quot;sees&quot; a problem when it becomes a big problem. And it's not designed to respond to (or even detect) &quot;too much inconsistency&quot;. Conquently, always prefer the Log View which shows you the actual numbers to the standard view which only shows you the approximate extraction time averaged over the last several (about 5, I think) shots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the numbers are &quot;too inconsistent&quot; (exercise your judgment), then you really need to run a cleaning cycle before trying to calibrate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alright, to actually calibrate a programmed button on a clean machine, take the grind a few clicks *coarser* than you think it should be set. Coarser flakes will help to scrub the doser channels between the grinder and the brewing chamber. With a very fine grind, the heat and moisture from the nearby brewing chamber will contribute to *caking* in the doser. That gives you a non-linear response from grind-time-adjustment/extraction-time-result. And it is this which I believe is the cause of the usual &quot;death-spiral&quot; of a Super-Automatic before it needs servicing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you've adjusted to a very coarse grind. Pull 3 or 4 (pairs of) shots, then start adjusting the grind finer 1 click at a time, then pull a shot. 1 click, 1 shot, 1 click, 1 shot. Then just follow house-rules for blackjack. Stand on 16 or 17. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It takes 2 or 3 pairs for a grind adjustment to take effect, depending upon the length of the doser channel in the particular kind of machine. So by the 1-click,1-shot cycle above, we have a 1 or 2 shot backlog of having adjusted finer. This will ride up to about 20sec shots if everything else is normal. So we stop adjusting when the shot times hit the bottom of the desired range.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Cross-Calibrating single-shot and double-shot programs at the same grind&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have single-shot and double-shot buttons which use the same grinder, then it's possible to have the singles pulling long with the doubles pulling short or any combination of good, bad, and ugly in between.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The procedure that seem to be working for me is to calibrate the longest program to be correct, and let the machine self-adjust the short program to compensate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Always, always, always, calibrate from the *coarse* side of things. This keeps the doser and brewing chamber scrubbed and avoid caking which leads to unpredictable results.&#xD;&#xA;" />

And this constitutes the &quot;frob&quot; of the dose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the &quot;frob&quot; of the water quantity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the extraction time was long, adjust the grind. This the &quot;frob&quot; of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, we've done our &quot;frob&quot; pass. Now &quot;twiddle.&quot; Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit.

You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its &quot;range&quot;, if you know what I mean. All the grinds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grinds resist going stale a little more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There should be no need to &quot;twiddle&quot; the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, one final pass to &quot;tweak&quot;. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white &quot;overextraction stain&quot; where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop *just before* the color changes. This tweak gives you &quot;ristretto-quality&quot; shots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Adjusting on-the-fly&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is &quot;comfortable&quot;. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to &quot;ride the wave&quot; of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same three adjustments, **frob**, **twiddle**, and **tweak**, apply also to dynamic adjustments. **Frob**, the *coarsest* control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. **Twiddle**, the *medium-grain* control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. **Tweak**, the *finest* control is the dose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a shot pulls 1-second too long, **tweak** your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a shot pulls 1-second too short, **tweak** your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), **twiddle** the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same *density* with more *mass*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), **twiddle** the grind a little finer so you can achieve the *density* with less *mass*.

Count how many clicks gets you to &quot;full&quot;, maybe a little heaping. This number is your *base* dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the &quot;frob&quot; of the dose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the &quot;frob&quot; of the water quantity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the extraction time was long, adjust the grind. This the &quot;frob&quot; of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, we've done our &quot;frob&quot; pass. Now &quot;twiddle.&quot; Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to &quot;twiddle&quot; per se: there's no *up and down&quot; here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its &quot;range&quot;, if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There should be no need to &quot;twiddle&quot; the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, one final pass to &quot;tweak&quot;. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white &quot;overextraction stain&quot; where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop *just before* the color changes. This tweak gives you &quot;ristretto-quality&quot; shots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Adjusting on-the-fly&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is &quot;comfortable&quot;. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to &quot;ride the wave&quot; of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same three adjustments, **frob**, **twiddle**, and **tweak**, apply also to dynamic adjustments. **Frob**, the *coarsest* control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. **Twiddle**, the *medium-grain* control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. **Tweak**, the *finest* control is the dose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a shot pulls 1-second too long, **tweak** your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a shot pulls 1-second too short, **tweak** your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), **twiddle** the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same *density* with more *mass*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), **twiddle** the grind a little finer so you can achieve the *density* with less *mass*. (Volume is constant.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser. And got it back to 20sec after 2 or 3 pairs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's how I know. But I learned this all from David Schomer's book.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/6v8sh.png" />

The rapid intake of sugar causes your pancreas to flood your blood stream with insulin, which then drops your blood sugar lower than it should go.

When I put dark roast beans into the grinder, the chute gets clogged with coffee grounds more quickly (as compared to lighter-roasted beans). I have a timer-based auto-shutoff model, and much less grounds come out when the grinder is &quot;clogged&quot; in this way. I attribute this clogging to the oil on the surface of the beans that is somehow &quot;sticky&quot; and more prevalent on darker roast beans, but I'm not certain. [This article from Coffee Geek](http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/questions/318466) talks about cleaning more frequently for darker roast beans, as does [this review from Seattle Coffee Gear](https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/learn/videos-home/ask-the-experts/burr-test-medium-dark-beans), as does [this one from Coffee Review](http://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-reference/from-crop-to-cup/grinding/burr-grinders/). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the topic of **espresso pulled from these grounds:** This is tricky and I'm really just speculating. Perhaps it's a similar situation: your darker-roast beans respond to tamping differently than your lighter-roast beans. If you're tamping hard and the grounds are clumping together somehow, you might be getting some channeling (resulting in uneven extraction); this could cause a more &quot;watery&quot; shot. You might be able to see evidence of this in the puck after you pull the shot, or you might be able to see it while pulling the shot if you use a naked (bottomless) portafilter. [This article from Home-Barista](https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-guide-diagnose-extraction-problems.html) talks about a too-quick extraction being paired with grind flaws; are you seeing that? It also discusses various other flaws and corrections, too various to summarize here.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Text="Lots of questions! Starting from the top...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Taste?** Coffee cherries are mild in flavour and slightly sweet. The flavour is somewhat reminiscent of other red fruits, like a mild mix of fruits like raspberry, red mulberry, currant, cranberry, cherry, raisin. I've only had them dried, so they have a little bit of a &quot;dried fruit&quot; taste (e.g., as raisins are to grapes). To me, they also have a little bit of a mild taste of tobacco leaf. When steeped in water to make a drink called [*cascara* (see this question/answers)](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/451/yemenite-tea-like-coffee). The beverage tastes to me a bit like rooibos (red bush tisane). Some coffee shops sell the beverage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Shipping?** I've only seen *dried* coffee cherries for sale. Perhaps &quot;fresh&quot; coffee fruits are available in the coffee belt, but the seeds (i.e., coffee beans) are so valuable that I think the whole fruit doesn't make it very far outside of production regions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Availability?** Various specialty retailers sell the dried fruit pulp and skins (some call them the &quot;husks&quot;) -- here's [one example from Verve](http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea). Searching for coffee berries, cherries, husks, or for beverages like *cascara* or *qishr* may reveal more outlets.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Other preservation?** Coffee skins/pulp dry well. Rehydrating is possible but underwhelming. I have tried to make a kind of marmalade out of them; see [this seminal question](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1508/what-variety-of-coffee-berries-are-good-for-jam), and also [a follow-up question of mine at Seasoned Advice](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/54942/how-should-i-make-jam-out-of-coffee-cherries-or-coffee-cherry-husks).

My thinking is that this is giving the beans time for the proper reactions to take place inside the beans without charring the outside.

Of course they are roasting much larger quantities than I am but it occurred to me that perhaps this longer roasting time is intentional and has some beneficial effect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm mostly aiming for a City or City+ roast level and want to know if lengthening the roast time beyond what I'm currently doing is a good idea?

Something that I got in that habit of doing when using moka pots is to boil the water before I put it in the Moka pot, then introducing it to heat, then removing shortly after it starts to percolate. Stumptown illustrates a similar method.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot. Though I'm not sure, I have never used an induction stove with a moka pot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###UPDATE:&#xD;&#xA;Something I had not considered is the boiling point increases with pressure. So it might be worth turning the heat up quite a bit beyond 212F/100C. Its pretty difficult to burn water. Then again if you're using an induction stove to avoid heat pollution on the moka pot, then you can just use a traditional stove with the method I described and avoid the need to use an induction stove." />

Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may also want to consider [rinsing your filter](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use), and see more about [wetting the grounds for coffee bloom](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/337/what-is-coffee-bloom).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

In fact, even things that *aren't* actually coffee (barley, tea, herbs, etc.) could be brewed like coffee in an AeroPress or other coffee-brewing equipment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But if fancy coffee is not your preference (or not practical, or not available, or whatever), try something different. And why not a cultural staple like Maxwell House (or Folgers or Nescafé or Eight O'Clock or Café du Monde or ...)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, a **mass-market coffee like this might *benefit* from AeroPress treatment.** For example, some of these blends include a significant portion of ***Robusta*** beans, which is a traditional component of many blends (including some Italian espresso blends). Robusta might have some advantages in an AeroPress. [Robusta produces **more crema**](http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/barista/10-14-2006) in espresso, and might be a way to get [more crema from AeroPress](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress). Robusta also has slightly **more caffeine** than *Arabica*, so that's something else you might be looking for. Since AeroPress (generally) infuses for less time than drip, **you might reduce a bit of the bitterness** sometimes present in mass-market coffees (regardless of bean makeup).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**There might be a few problems, though.** First, the default grind of pre-ground coffee like **Maxwell House is rather course** for an AeroPress. You could try to re-grind the coffee to be a bit finer, but it's generally not recommended because it can clog grinders (see more on this from [Home-Barista](http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/can-ground-coffee-be-re-ground-t29153.html) and [Bunn](http://www.bunn.com/dr-brew-blog/re-grinding-coffee)). Second, if there are other &quot;stuff&quot; in the coffee (e.g., &quot;Folgers Crystals&quot; or other additives) this might not behave the same way in the AeroPress as it might for drip.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But give it a try! In the best case, you can enjoy a mass-market coffee even more than you'd expect. In the worst case, you're out a few quid, but you have a fun story and a hefty caffeine buzz.&#xD;&#xA;" />

You do indeed have a [vacuum coffee maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_coffee_maker) -- a.k.a. vac-pot, syphon, or siphon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**This style of vac-pot is intended to be used on a stove-top** (specifically: having a flat bottom, and with a handle on the neck of the bottom part -- the &quot;bulb&quot;) -- looks a lot like [this current model from Bodum - c/o Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Bodum-Santos-Stovetop-Vacuum-34-Ounce/dp/B00005NCX5). There's a good primer on [the history and types of vac-pot at WeCraveCoffee](http://www.wecravecoffee.com/siphon-vacuum-coffee-makers-a-complete-guide/) with some good pictures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in general, **glass pots are generally not recommended on flat [glass-ceramic cooktops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass-ceramic#Cooktops)** for a couple of reasons: they can *scratch or otherwise damage* each other, and the poor conductivity of glass makes glass-on-glass heating *less efficient*. More info on this from [a question on Seasoned Advice](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/23051/what-kind-of-cookware-is-suitable-for-a-glass-ceramic-stovetop), and recommendations from [GE Appliances](http://www.geappliances.com/search/fast/infobase/10000221.htm) for their own stovetops. I did see some products [such as this one](http://www.dhgate.com/product/unified-little-mini-electric-ceramic-stove/235473464.html) that depicted glass vac-pots on glass-ceramic cooktops. If all of the glass is high quality, as should be expected for cookware intended to be used on a stove, it *should* be able to withstand the temperature changes induced by a cooktop. I (personally) would be comfortable using this vac-pot on a *gas* flame, but cautious/wary of using it on glass-ceramic cooktop. Glass cookware works well over gas flame, but I have less experience with glass cooktops... your &quot;mileage&quot; may vary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a more &quot;DIY&quot; adventure as you suggest, **consider a mechanism to suspend the vac-pot over a flame heat source**. Other styles of vac-pot (such as [this Hario model - c/o Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Hario-TCA-3-Syphon-Siphon-Vacuum/dp/B000IKLQY6)) have a scaffolding that holds the bulb (bottom) and the hopper (top) so the whole apparatus can be suspended over a separate heat source, like an alcohol or butane stove. Check some vac-pot brewing guides that show this type of integrated round-bottom bulb and holder (e.g., from [Blue Bottle](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/siphon), [Stumptown](https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/vacuum-pot), [CoffeeGeek](http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee), and many others). Warning: this may remind you of Chemistry lab from School. ;-) And of course be careful with fire.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;Separately, just for completeness...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It also looks like you're missing the filter piece. These are inexpensive (relative to the whole apparatus) and you'll want to purchase a new, compatible one anyway (see also another question on [siphon filter replacement](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/253/how-often-do-i-need-to-change-the-filter-on-a-siphon)). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Another thing you'll want to check is that the rubber seal between the bottom and top parts is still in good shape**, especially if this pot hasn't been used in a few decades. This is for reasons both practical (you need a tight seal for the vacuum to work well) and safety (you don't want the seal to come lose and spray boiling-hot water everywhere)!&#xD;&#xA;" />

Reason being that their extraction times are so low that is usually not practical to press a fine grind coffee. Though this isn't a _direct_ answer to your question, I'd recommend grinding your coffee directly before brewing. This is best practice, and it means you can grind your coffee to whichever coarseness that you need.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to french press this coffee I think it would be best to adjust your extraction time. If you're using an espresso grind I'd do a short bloom, then extract for 45seconds. If the coffee is sour or bland increase extraction time. If the coffee tastes too bitter, then try decreasing the extraction time. Bloom for maybe 8 seconds. It's hard to tell, most people press coffee because they like pressed coffee, and they'll usually use a coarse grind for this. Using a fine grind will likely negate the benefits of using a press pot, and could very well be impossible/very difficult to consistently get a good cup." />

Starbucks does not have any patented magic equipment that  lets them pull shots faster than any other coffee house (that I am aware of).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you enjoy their beverages, then there probably isn't any reason you shouldn't continue to drink it.  I would guess you are in the minority of people buy what amounts to black coffee from Starbucks.  Starbucks is a fairly divisive brand among most consumers.  Most of the people I have talked to that like their beverages are buying mixed drinks from them and not straight espresso, drip coffee or americanos.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Starbucks does sell organic, fair trade and the like specialty coffees as whole bean or ground.  However, the vast majority of their beverages sold daily is likely made with whatever their &quot;espresso&quot; blend is.  My personal opinion is that it's horrible and over roasted.   However, it's also consistently the same tasting and consumed on a fairly mass scale daily, so if there were any inherent dangers to it, we'd likely all be aware by now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a brand, Starbucks is mainly aimed at consistency.  In general, that's what fast food chains strive for as well, so in that respect, they are very similar.  Proper branding ensures that you can buy a product at any of hundreds of locations (or thousands) and it will taste the same.  However, many consumers prize quality and uniqueness over consistency.  In most industries (distilling, wine, food, beer) the most expensive and &quot;highest end products&quot; are items that were perhaps only produced at a limited run, or were very good in a particular year.  That mindset tends to be the antithesis of the mass produced &quot;good enough for everyone&quot; standards that huge market brands set for themselves.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**TL;DR Summary:**  Yes, Starbucks shares many characteristics with fast food companies.  The most notable aspect being their branding strategies and tactics.    &#xD;&#xA;" />

Having used this method for many years now I think it gives consistently good coffee, comparable to that from a good espresso machine but without the need for machinery or paper filters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Recipe:** Bring one cup's worth of water to a boil in a small pot. Add about a scoop and a half of ground decent-quality beans to the pot. Swirl gently until chalky bubbles appear. Filter through a tea strainer into a cup. Let stand briefly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No need to grind the beans to a powder. The tea-strainer gets most of the grounds and the amount of sediment in the cup is about the same as in cafe espresso. The only electric component is a coffee grinder. Using pre-ground beans requires more coffee per cup, as some flavor will be missing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general this method produces coffee that is slightly weaker than espresso. While I might add a bit of sugar to espresso to counter bitterness if the beans are old or mediocre, the strainer method above gives coffee that is very drinkable without sugar. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It sometimes surprises me that this simple method isn't more widely used. **Has anyone else tried it?** Are there any drawbacks to this method? It isn't worth much commercially because it only makes decent coffee one cup at a time.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This method is adapted from one I saw used by fisherman in Brazil, except he used a sock instead of a tea strainer. Comments welcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  " />

There are roughly [800 volatile molecular components][1] found in coffee and much of it evaporates within several days of resting and/or minutes after grinding. A true coffee snob is very interested in a &quot;roast date&quot; rather than a &quot;best by date&quot; because it gives you a read on freshness rather than the fabricated &quot;expiration&quot; that the roaster arbitrarily puts on the bag. Imagine selecting bread at a bakery and they won't tell you the day it's baked, it is rather mind boggling!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since starbucks is an international chain, coffee freshness does not become a economical priority when servicing thousands of stores and millions of customers.

So I do know some things, but I'm not speaking officially on their behalf. Any errors of fact or inference are my own.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The core ingredients Starbucks uses are real ingredients. Coffee, milk, filtered water. Not all of the coffees are organic, but there are efforts underway throughout the world to reinvest in the farms and communities, etc etc. I'm sure there are specific priorities in each area, and going (California-certified) organic is not necessarily the highest. Education, clean water, economic concerns could each be more significant to a specific area (just speculating, and rationalizing; but it's all reasonable, right?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some stuff is more artificial. The pumpkin sauce. The whipping cream is a little thinned with skim milk and thickened back up with carrageenan. But the mocha sauce is just cocoa, sugar, vanillin, hot water + elbow grease.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some other detail-ish concerns, there are things like food coloring. Now AFAIK, Red no.40 is what everybody uses to add red and pink to stuff. So the choice is natural or artificial? Easy right? What if I tell you they're indistinguishable in a lab? Still easy, right? What if I tell you the natural version is extracted from bugs? Yeah, insect extract. Now let's consider: natural or artificial? Still easy?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not even sure which is in the pink cake pops at the moment. But, if you're getting something bright pink, how worried are you really? Is that wrong, to turn the whole question back? I don't know. But if you take any of these &quot;health fiascos *du jour*&quot; too seriously, ... um, where was I going with that? Just keep your brain turned on, as per usual.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One litmus test I use to rate other stores is whether they keep their shot glasses rinsed. If they do that, then they most likely have the other standards for cleanliness and quality under control.

Specifically the Starbucks Mastrena machine, but the ideas should generalize to othe machines of the same class.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Rinsing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should always be rinsing. You are not done rinsing until the water runs clear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Cleaning&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the machine is acting up, give it a cleaning cycle. If a coworker challenges you, ask them why they want to serve bad shots??! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you cannot take the machine down for a cycle (it's too busy at that moment), the following should help, but is no substitute. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Super-automatics that have run hot all morning and then sat relatively idle through midmorning and then run hot again for the after-lunch crowd have what I call the &quot;oatmeal bowl problem&quot;. If you eat some oatmeal and don't rinse the bowl right away, what happens? You know what happens! It gets hard. It becomes a crust. The same thing happens inside the machine. You need to run a cleaning cycle. For reals, dog.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Calibrating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm assuming you don't have access to the real programming mode. So the control here are very, very limited. You can adjust the grind, rinse, and pull shots with one of several programmed buttons. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each programed button maintains a log of the parameters and measurements of the last few shots upon which it performs some simple statistical analysis to determine when to print &quot;adjust grind coarser&quot; or &quot;adjust grind finer&quot; on the screen. So, the machine only &quot;sees&quot; a problem when it becomes a big problem. And it's not designed to respond to (or even detect) &quot;too much inconsistency&quot;. Conquently, always prefer the Log View which shows you the actual numbers to the standard view which only shows you the approximate extraction time averaged over the last several (about 5, I think) shots. On the Mastrena machine, switch to Log View by pressing the Up and Down buttons at the same time; switch back to normal view by pressing Cancel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the numbers are &quot;too inconsistent&quot; (exercise your judgment), then you really need to run a cleaning cycle before trying to calibrate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alright, to actually calibrate a programmed button on a clean machine, take the grind a few clicks *coarser* than you think it should be set. Coarser flakes will help to scrub the doser channels between the grinder and the brewing chamber. With a very fine grind, the heat and moisture from the nearby brewing chamber will contribute to *caking* in the doser. That gives you a non-linear response from grind-time-adjustment/extraction-time-result. And it is this which I believe is the cause of the usual &quot;death-spiral&quot; of a Super-Automatic before it needs servicing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you've adjusted to a very coarse grind. Pull 3 or 4 (pairs of) shots, then start adjusting the grind finer 1 click at a time, then pull a shot. 1 click, 1 shot, 1 click, 1 shot. Then just follow house-rules for blackjack. Stand on 16 or 17. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It takes 2 or 3 pairs for a grind adjustment to take effect, depending upon the length of the doser channel in the particular kind of machine. So by the 1-click,1-shot cycle above, we have a 1 or 2 shot backlog of having adjusted finer. This will ride up to about 20sec shots if everything else is normal. So we stop adjusting when the shot times hit the bottom of the desired range.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Cross-Calibrating single-shot and double-shot programs at the same grind&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have single-shot and double-shot buttons which use the same grinder, then it's possible to have the singles pulling long with the doubles pulling short or any combination of good, bad, and ugly in between.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The procedure that seem to be working for me is to calibrate the longest program to be correct, and let the machine self-adjust the short program to compensate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Always, always, always, calibrate from the *coarse* side of things. This keeps the doser and brewing chamber scrubbed and avoids caking which leads to unpredictable results.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Sometimes when I'm pressed for time, the just-used pot sits in the sink for a few hours without getting disassembled or rinsed. I have a hunch that that moisture may be contributing here. I use filtered water, so I don't think they are mineral deposits (unlike in [this case](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1847/moka-pot-buildup)). The pot is pretty new. It's been used 1-3 times per day for about three weeks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what are these spots? If they aren't affecting the flavor of the result, do I need to worry about them? If so, how can they be removed?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y21rR.jpg" />

I end up with a relatively crema-y shot. You'd never mistake it for one from an espresso machine, but there's a good layer all across the top. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is completely unscientific and I can't identify which steps here are the relevant ones for the good results, but maybe if you experiment with some of these adjustments you can identify what works and what doesn't. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Equipment&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Aeropress&#xD;&#xA;* Scoop that came with the Aeropress&#xD;&#xA;* [Ultra fine mesh filter](http://www.amazon.com/Filter-AeroPress-Ultra-Stainless-Coffee/dp/B00A1GVVMY)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Coffee&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The beans I use vary; I generally grab a light or medium roast off the shelves at Trader Joes and grind it one click down from the finest setting on the in-store grinder. (The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's [Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee](http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Jamaica-Mountain-Coffee/dp/B00GK5R8IG), a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says [it's the best bet](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html) for Trader Joe's coffee.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Water&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Method&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Set up the Aeropress for [inverted brewing](http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/).&#xD;&#xA;2. For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&#xD;&#xA;3. Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a [gooseneck kettle](http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg) for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&#xD;&#xA;4. Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&#xD;&#xA;5. Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&#xD;&#xA;6. Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* My results vary significantly. I *think* the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&#xD;&#xA;* I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit Redux:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I [mentioned below](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress/165#comment772_165), all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and [an app full of AeroPress recipes](http://aeropresstimer.com); thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally. I'll track the results [here](https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0) and update this answer when and if I come up with a reliable way to generate and preserve the foam on my AeroPress shots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Edit The Third:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The results are in](https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0): I've figured out how to stop killing my crema. It turns out that the combination of **freshly ground beans** and **the mesh metal filter** is somehow stopping the crema from getting through to the cup. Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the plot thickens. My [colleague Robert](http://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/137/robert-cartaino) asserts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Never had a problem getting crema with aeropress. Lots of fresh coffee ground to a powder, very little very hot water. Makes my ubercoffee syrup shots I talked about a year or more ago... with plenty o crema. Dilute to taste (which I never did &lt; jitter &gt;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...and I'm not entirely sure, but if memory serves, switching to the fine metal mesh filter meant bye-bye to crema. It's been a bit too long to remember for certain. I just reused the same paper filter over and over for months (actually, I used two to keep them from blowing out).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it would seem that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Freshly, very finely ground coffee + paper filter + not much water = crema city&#xD;&#xA;* Coffee ground fine in the store + metal filter + water = crema town&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd be interested to see others' results from experiments like these." />

Unfortunately the symptoms you're seeing, from my perspective, is a classic *failure* of the Bialetti design. Aluminum tarnishes (oxidizes) somewhat readily, especially when it is hot and in contact with water.

Aluminum oxide generally protects the metal from further oxidation (unlike rust -- iron oxide -- which flakes off and *facilitates* further oxidation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have a stainless steel moka pot, and it's terribly tarnished on the outside from heating on a gas burner hundreds of times, but the inside is clean (and clean*able*) as the metaphorical &quot;whistle&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For completeness: It's also possible that they are mineral deposits; [this answer](http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html) to the other question that you linked has some additional info about that possibility. It would come from a buildup (&quot;scale&quot;) from using &quot;hard&quot; water, and more so when nearly boiling dry (also not a good idea); filtered or distilled water is much less likely to do this. However, I think it's unlikely that you'd see scale buildup over the span of a couple dozen uses.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Another Italian coffee, this coffee is and is brewed by:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Lungo is Italian for 'long', and refers to the coffee beverage made by using an espresso machine to make an Italian style coffee - short black with much more water, resulting in a stretched coffee, a lungo. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now don't be fooled by this as to make this coffee, you need an espresso machine&#xD;&#xA;to make this creation. You just need more-than-normal amount of water and short black (single or double dose or shot).
