Physics tells us that pressured water flow will take the path of least resistance. By this logic, the tamp functions by making the coffee bed smooth, even, and robust enough to be hit with 9 bars of pressure and extract evenly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Barista Health&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: In no way am I a qualified physician.

Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&quot;&gt;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24" LastActivityDate="2015-01-27T21:35:46.843" CommentCount="0" />

This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCIENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949&quot;&gt;http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="38" LastEditorUserId="38" LastEditDate="2015-01-27T22:37:40.693" LastActivityDate="2015-01-27T22:37:40.693" CommentCount="0" />

Very simple and straightforward without a lot of nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt; the toasted character has diminished and the nuances have developed a lot more. You can really notice the difference between bean origins. There is much more powerful rich &quot;amazing coffee&quot; aroma. I find the sheer quantity of aroma very appealing at 24-48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some beans continue to change for &lt;strong&gt;several days after roasting&lt;/strong&gt;. Recently I had a batch of Indonesian beans that were still developing and becoming more characteristically Indonesian after a week. I liked them more, but someone else might have liked them less.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that, when it comes down to it, is what matters.

While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as &quot;decaffeinated&quot;, they are better termed &quot;uncaffeinated&quot; because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Want to know even more?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Advanced&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Swiss Water process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; process&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sourced from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not my opinion although I don't have decaf, but just something I picked up on the net:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/j5w3t.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I don&amp;#39;t know?!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="132" LastActivityDate="2015-01-28T13:34:08.870" CommentCount="0" />

Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. &lt;em&gt;It is said to help improve&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;crema&lt;/strong&gt;. &#xA;One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available.

After roasting, they continue to be affected by environmental factors, their own natural instability, and interaction with other compounds. The most important of these processes are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dissipation into other media. Aromatics evaporate from the surface of the coffee into the atmosphere or are dissolved into solvents, where they often interact with other chemicals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Non-enzymatic browning reactions. These involve carbohydrates, usually sugars, in carmelization and Maillard reactions. Carmelization occurs when a sugar gives up water and carbon dioxide, changing the structure of the sugar and its taste. The Maillard reaction is the result of an interaction between amino acids and carbohydrates in which an aromatically perceived substance is formed. When the Maillard reaction takes place at a high temperature (as in coffee roasting), the result is usually desirable roasted flavors and aromas, but when it takes place at a lower temperature, the result is flat, gluey, and cardboard-like flavors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Oxidation. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different compounds. In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived) compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The engine that drives all of these processes forward is thermal energy (heat).

Coffee is a crappy growth medium        and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy.&#xA;  Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it won’t actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool – but not in the refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans you’ve ground yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans. Don’t know how to find amazing, fresh coffee? I wrote a guide on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what you do, you will not be able to get that fresh flavor back once it has left the bean.

(The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00GK5R8IG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, a delightful medium roast.

There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Method&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set up the Aeropress for &lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;inverted brewing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gooseneck kettle&lt;/a&gt; for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My results vary significantly. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit Redux:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results.

It turns out that the combination of &lt;strong&gt;freshly ground beans&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;the mesh metal filter&lt;/strong&gt; is somehow stopping the crema from getting through to the cup. Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the plot thickens.

This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Differences by Region&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/5FChz.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sour &amp;amp; Acidity in coffee by Country&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Green Processing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9Xa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp;amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Age of the Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn6eJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acid Degradation over Time&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Level of Roast&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/uajzo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Acidity VS Level of Roast&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Italian&quot; or even &quot;Spanish&quot; roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, &lt;strike&gt;and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible.&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the&#xA;  roasting process (at about 120 sec).  While acrylamide is still&#xA;  detectable in fully roasted and burnt coffees, it most likely don’t&#xA;  contribute to the unpleasant, burnt flavor in over-roasted coffee. &#xA;  Multiple studies suggest that the main chemicals that cause bad&#xA;  flavors in burnt coffee are heterocyclic aromatic amines and&#xA;  polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  These increase with roasting temperature&#xA;  and time and many compounds that fall into these categories are known&#xA;  or suspected carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Differences by Brewing Method&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An extension to this question, reviewing the differences in the level of acidity by brewing method has been answered here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/349/could-preparation-method-make-coffee-more-acidic/&quot;&gt;Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="80" LastEditDate="2015-02-17T23:38:05.800" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T23:38:05.800" CommentCount="3" />

This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what is the full story? Read on! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sour &amp;amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp;amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; acidic than its cold brewed counter part. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Differences in Average Flavor Profile&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png&quot; alt=&quot;Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee&quot;&gt;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png&quot; alt=&quot;Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee&quot;&gt;&#xA;This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and &#xA;acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water.

For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article is helpful:&lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&quot;&gt;https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastEditorUserId="80" LastEditDate="2015-02-17T23:37:22.793" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T23:37:22.793" CommentCount="4" />

However, even the highest quality plants still need to be tended to and grown in the right environment.  So farming methods and location play a part.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a coffee cherry is grown and picked, it must be processed to get at the bean.  The fruit must be removed somehow and there are various ways to do this, any or all of which can influence the final flavor of the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those beans are then often sorted to create homogenous lots of coffee beans, some folks will claim that this sorting can influence final outcome as well.  Assuming the green beans are properly stored and shipped, they arrive finally at a roaster.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A roaster has potentially the most influence on the final outcome.  They may blend different lots of beans base on a want for a particular flavor profile (or to save money).  And they decide what roast either fits their business model or is best for the beans.  The very same batch of beans will produce drastically different cups of coffee (or espresso) based on the roast level.  Then there is storage of roasted beans.  Some companies grind their coffee before sale, which increases the rate (drastically) at which coffee stales.  Others sell the beans whole.  These will stale too and the rate depends on storage time and method.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally there is the actual method of brewing.  There is a myriad of methods, with some new ones even invented in the last decade.

Mix the grinds and water, then using a screen, separate the grinds from the water. The taste is going to depend more on how clean the press is, the quality and temperature of the water, the quality of the bean, grind, how long you let it brew, etc. The same holds true for pour-over brews, provided that the filter is decent and doesn't add its own taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally prefer my press, but it's really a matter of preference.

It is called ISSpresso and is the&#xA;  brainchild of two Italian companies — Argotec and Lavazza — in&#xA;  collaboration with the Italian Space Agency&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Turin, 13 June 2014 – “An espresso coffee is what I miss most aboard&#xA;  the International Space Station.” We have repeatedly heard this&#xA;  comment from the Italian astronauts who for 13 years have been at&#xA;  times working in the International Space Station, and today their&#xA;  espresso wish is about to become reality. In fact, Argotec and Lavazza&#xA;  are working together with the Italian Space Agency (ISA) to actually&#xA;  bring the authentic Italian espresso onto the International Space&#xA;  Station. So in the Futura Mission — the second long-term mission of&#xA;  the Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station — another Italian&#xA;  astronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha&#xA;  Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into&#xA;  space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic&#xA;  Italian espresso in orbit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Its name is ISSpresso.&lt;/strong&gt; It takes its name from the International Space&#xA;  Station (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first&#xA;  capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions&#xA;  of space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of&#xA;  liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.&#xA;  ISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian&#xA;  engineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and&#xA;  European leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for&#xA;  in-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.&#xA;  ISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to&#xA;  deliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it&#xA;  was selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in&#xA;  the framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the&#xA;  Agency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects&#xA;  and activities to be carried out in the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Italian coffee is a beverage without borders — comments &lt;strong&gt;Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President&#xA;  of Lavazza&lt;/strong&gt; — and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into&#xA;  space for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched&#xA;  the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by&#xA;  Thierry Le Gouès and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the&#xA;  time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually&#xA;  just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to&#xA;  overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso — the&#xA;  indisputable symbol of made in Italy products — on board the&#xA;  International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major&#xA;  project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our&#xA;  division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific&#xA;  and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and&#xA;  nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“Our aerospace engineers — stated &lt;strong&gt;David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  — have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the&#xA;  astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also&#xA;  thanks to Lavazza’s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2&#xA;  systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:&#xA;  Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra&#xA;  high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable&#xA;  with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological&#xA;  challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the&#xA;  Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.&#xA;  In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of&#xA;  the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. Food provides an&#xA;  important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian&#xA;  espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed&#xA;  especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to&#xA;  home.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;  “ISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS&#xA;  national usage rights available to public-private partnership&#xA;  initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for&#xA;  technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring&#xA;  ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements&#xA;  with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of&#xA;  improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the&#xA;  astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary&#xA;  exploration missions. At the same time, we are also proud to&#xA;  contribute to the promotion of the image and spreading of the&#xA;  Made-in-Italy brand at international or better “space”, level.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A coffee break in space.&lt;/strong&gt; A prototype of the space coffee machine is&#xA;  currently being tested at Argotec’s laboratories and all the necessary&#xA;  functional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica –&#xA;  Selex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at&#xA;  launching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of&#xA;  whom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The ‘corner&#xA;  café’ on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,&#xA;  a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,&#xA;  chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in&#xA;  missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a&#xA;  very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also&#xA;  be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffè lungo&#xA;  or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can&#xA;  also be rehydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra-terrestrial technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Every tiniest detail&#xA;  of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering&#xA;  challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of&#xA;  physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of&#xA;  handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space&#xA;  environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water&#xA;  inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special&#xA;  steel tube &lt;strong&gt;designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar.&lt;/strong&gt; The&#xA;  machine is so complex that it weighs &lt;strong&gt;about 20 kilograms since there&#xA;  are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in&#xA;  accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space&#xA;  Agency.&lt;/strong&gt; ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project&#xA;  which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’&#xA;  menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid&#xA;  dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted&#xA;  have led to international patents, which will be useful both for&#xA;  future space missions and immediate terrestrial use...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/24/space-station-coffee-maker-perfect-espresso&quot;&gt;Just found images on The Guardian:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/LA1Kv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And on &lt;a href=&quot;http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&quot;&gt;http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/RC8Kj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="31" LastEditorUserId="31" LastEditDate="2015-02-01T15:30:15.773" LastActivityDate="2015-02-01T15:30:15.773" CommentCount="6" />

At what point this bacteria become dangerous not only depends on temperature but also how clean the flask was to begin with and what quality water is being used. Clean tap water in the US, brewing coffee in a very clean french press, and placed into an incredibly clean flask could last two weeks (although it would taste terrible and have little caffeine) but if any of those steps is less than ideal there is a good chance of bacteria growth.

Caffeine should not burn at any temperature coffee is left at, and it does not evaporate. So either experiments that say caffeine levels decrease are wrong or the reason it decreases is not clear.

Ground coffee has something between 27-30% of its mass being soluble, that is, stuff you can dissolve in water. If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually you’d get everything that the grounds have to give. Above 22-24%, however, and you’ve essentially reached too far or squeezed too hard, because unpleasant flavors will emerge. Below 18%, and you’re not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, “How much did you get from the grounds?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit more… something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and you’re in the “heavy, thick” coffee zone. Simply put,“How much ended up in the cup?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ratio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L? No… but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the assistance of common men like me,&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rjtoe.gif&quot; alt=&quot;YEAHAHAHA!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, to clarify the actual number, if Arabica then 1 - 1.5 pounds per cycle and if Robusta 2 - 2.75 pounds.

One scoop of&#xA;beans weighs about &lt;strong&gt;12 grams&lt;/strong&gt; (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh&#xA;once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight&#xA;and volume).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/NwqDW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if I &lt;em&gt;eat&lt;/em&gt; that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them&#xA;with any amount of water I will be consuming the &lt;strong&gt;120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation&#xA;exercise. &lt;em&gt;The strongest &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with&#xA;that scoop of beans will have &lt;strong&gt;no more than&lt;/strong&gt; 120mg caffeine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How strong is my cup?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%&#xA;considered optimal&lt;/a&gt; whereas &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%&quot;&#xA;solids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water&#xA;(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 30-60mg, or 38mg for&#xA;optimal brewed coffee and 60mg for espresso). That would be the upper&#xA;limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand,&#xA;the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,&#xA;so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per&#xA;oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz&lt;/a&gt;. That's&#xA;a pretty huge range. But it means caffeine is a lot of what gets dissolved—25-50% of the solids in an ounce of brewed coffee or 50-83% of the solids in an ounce of espresso.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of&#xA;beans containing a maximum of 120mg caffeine. So let's say that maximum 12 mg per oz is the &quot;too strong&quot; concentration above, with around 1.65% solids including almost 100% of the caffeine. If I brew&#xA;it &quot;too weak&quot; and it ends up 1% solids (60% of the &quot;too strong&quot; solids) I would guess&#xA;I'd proportionally get no more than 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg per oz or 72 mg&#xA;for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg of caffeine in my cup depending on the brew strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so I'm going to estimate my typical cup contains &lt;strong&gt;around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee,&lt;/strong&gt; or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would suggest a decent&#xA;rule of thumb for &quot;optimal&quot; strength American-style brewed coffee is around &lt;strong&gt;0.8% of the mass of the beans used, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Bonus corollary/sanity check&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-drinks/2733-how-much-grounds-used-make-espresso.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;7g of ground&#xA;coffee&lt;/a&gt; maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the &lt;strong&gt;64mg/shot&lt;/strong&gt; reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/#q=caffeine%20in%20espresso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the USDA and others&lt;/a&gt; also ends up being 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="86" LastEditorUserId="86" LastEditDate="2015-02-05T20:39:43.127" LastActivityDate="2015-02-05T20:39:43.127" CommentCount="0" />

I know that it sounds trivial, but the quality of water can affect how &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; coffee tastes. It can render your espresso tart, or turn your Folgers into mud pie soup. This should also result in less build up of 'gunk' in your machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, eliminate your filters as a cause of bad taste. To do this, heat some water to about 95 degrees Celsius, pour it through a few of the filters and into a container to cool. Wait for it to cool, smell and taste the water. Any after taste or odor? You got it from the filters, change your brand. While it's not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; true, the more expensive the filter, the better the chance that it's not going to shed fibers or tastes into your brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, have your machine cleaned. Ask any diner who does it for them, and take it to wherever that is. Stuff can build up that a simple cleaning can't handle, the machine should be broken down and cleaned thoroughly, especially if you're getting that vegemite-like 'burnt'  taste to things. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if Maxwell House is the coffee everyone can agree on, try putting a pinch of kosher salt in the basket with the grinds before you brew - it can &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; help to bring out latent flavors that might still be in the beans (provided that the coffee is still reasonably fresh), it won't make the coffee taste salty. Not much, 10 crystals or less, but try adding a pinch. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think pound for pound, you'll get the most out of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Having the machine professionally cleaned&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Having better water delivered, and using that to brew&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tossing a few crystals of kosher salt in with the grinds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine you've got is a classic workhorse, and I'm sure it's got plenty of get-up-and-go left, but it does need to be maintained periodically.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="101" LastActivityDate="2015-02-05T00:51:49.080" CommentCount="0" />

I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts. But the crema and freshness is always long gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that must secretly be the real reason for a long black—by adding the espresso to the top of drinkable-temperature water, you still have a chance at the best flavors and aromas.

Basically the way it works is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get a load of volunteers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;By doing questionnaires, work out everything about them&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Track them over a long period of time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for &lt;em&gt;causation&lt;/em&gt;, only for &lt;em&gt;correlation&lt;/em&gt;. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember also that medical studies are &lt;em&gt;chronically&lt;/em&gt; badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt;. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One tool against all of this uncertainty is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.).

Think of it as a sophisticated way of 'averaging them out'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174313206X152546&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;One of these was done&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.

Water is put into a bottom vessel; coffee grounds are placed on a perforated platform with attached cone, which is placed on/in the water vessel; a top holding tank with rubber gasket is screwed on top of the apparatus. The device is placed over a heat source, boiling the water;  the boiling water creates steam and pressure, which forces water through the grounds into the upper storage vessel.  The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/262&quot;&gt;this answer&lt;/a&gt;).

There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept (stovetop coffee production devices), they're (to me) totally different in outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect, but I don't know, if there are regional differences in these terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: this &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/q/60/262&quot;&gt;meta question&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/a/74/262&quot;&gt;my answer&lt;/a&gt; prompted this adaptation as a clarification question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2015-02-11T16:27:59.070" LastActivityDate="2015-02-11T16:27:59.070" CommentCount="0" />

The acidity in black coffee is higher than the acidity in soy milk, though, and it can act like a coagulant, making like loose tofu in your cup of coffee. The heat of your soy milk can actually &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HELP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; curdle the soy milk even more, rather than preventing it.

Here are my reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moka pots - They use small amounts of pressurized water flowing through the coffee grind to make a fine stovetop espresso. The brewing process is relatively cheap and nearly uses the same amount of pressure as a actual espresso machine.

Steeping might not really the word here but here is how they do it:&#xA;The percolator heats the water from the bottom to create steam.

In my experience in messing with this, &lt;strong&gt;I have not found the order of adding ingredients makes much difference&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., putting coffee into the soya milk). &lt;strong&gt;It absolutely depends on the type of coffee&lt;/strong&gt;, also, because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;different coffees will have different degrees of acidity&lt;/a&gt;.

In this order, these allow temperature and acid (respectively) to more slowly come into balance between the two substances as they are being combined.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMHO, I have found &lt;em&gt;the brand&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., the ingredients and production methods) of the soya milk to be the biggest factor. I (personally, with not-entirely-scientific -- yet! -- trials) find that &lt;strong&gt;soya milk brands that contain emulsifiers (or other additives) are less likely to curdle in coffee&lt;/strong&gt;.  My only guesses are that &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;these compounds (emulsifiers, thickeners, or stabilisers, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;carrageenan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;xanthan gum&lt;/a&gt;) interfere with the coagulation, or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;something else in the processing (perhaps, e.g., pasteurisation) has denatured the proteins or otherwise chemically changed the nutrients such that they are less likely (cf., UHT or ultra-pasteurised milk)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I generally prefer to avoid the additives, so this is an unfortunate conclusion for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Freshness of the milk is also an issue; milk of all types will spoil and slowly start to curdle due to natural processes (fermentation, bacteria, other contamination).

Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Loss of heat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering your final question about duration of freshness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale.

It consists of a single-shot of espresso (25 mL / ~0.8 fl. oz.), textured (steamed) milk, and &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 1 cm of foam (other places suggest 2 cm).

So I read about it... and tried (only) a sip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea seems to be to flood yourself with stimulants and concentrated sources of macronutrient energy. According to the linked Wikipedia article (additional references available there), MCTs (Medium-chain triglycerides) are easy for the body to absorb and use (they require less digestion and less energy to use). MCTs are also purported to have appetite-surpressing and energy-burning benefits (Wikipedia article has links on both sides of that debate). The idea of butter (especially organic butter from pasture-raised animals) is to provide beneficial fatty acids (organic/pasture-raised butter purportedly having better Omega-3 content (see another &lt;a href=&quot;http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/6707&quot;&gt;skeptics.SE question about this&lt;/a&gt;) and vitamins -- both being purported for &quot;energy&quot; benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's my take on the &quot;theory&quot; anyway; hopefully someone else has better links to some peer-reviewed study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried this concoction once, and found it (personally) to be not tasty enough to drink.

French Press (full immersion brewing) is the least acidic, and V60 (a type of pour-over) has the widest range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is there something else going on here?&lt;/strong&gt; &#xA;What if there exists a conflating factor such as green processing, roast level, or growing environment?

No. &#xA;What we're seeing here is that each continent tends towards a different green processing technique, and thus a different optimal level of roast - all of which exert as much influence over the resulting level of acidity in the flavor profile of the coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Please just save me from exogenous variables&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh... you should have just said so.... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/kmild.png&quot; alt=&quot;Inference Tree of Acidity in Coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a conditional inference tree mapping the distribution of acidity scores to a series of categorical variables. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where:&#xA;C is Country &#xA;P is Preparation &#xA;G is Green Processing&#xA;and the bar plot shows the distribution of acidity&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Country is clearly the most used variable in creating this tree, and interestingly, Green Processing is only used as a splitting rule when a country has a verity of green processing methods in common use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please leave a comment if you'd like me to add a variable or further analysis to this answer! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="100" LastActivityDate="2015-02-17T19:35:44.027" CommentCount="3" />

It is an oxymoron to have a zero calorie energy drink, but there are plenty of them on the market.  That being said, there are many coffee drinks out there that add calories to your morning stimulant routine.

The diet requires you to cut out as many carbohydrates as possible out of your diet in order to get your body into a state of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis&quot;&gt;ketosis&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the energy in the body is produced by processing fat instead of carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When following the keto diet, you need to eat a lot of fat, minimum carbohydrates and a reasonable amount of protein. The goal is to get most of your calories from fat. Getting in all the fat that is required is often difficult, so in that context, bulletproof coffee is nothing more than a delivery method for fat. There's nothing special about it, it's just easier to drink a spoonful of butter melted in coffee than eating it on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to read up on keto further, the keto reddit has lots of resources on it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/keto&quot;&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/keto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="339" LastActivityDate="2015-02-18T00:35:16.797" CommentCount="2" />

The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think &lt;strong&gt;you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub&lt;/strong&gt;. However, &lt;strong&gt;any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew&lt;/strong&gt; (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262&quot;&gt;this question about coffee going stale&lt;/a&gt; -- one answer says it only takes minutes!

You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning...

Thus, while shade cover may prove advantageous in Central America it might actually lead to a fall in yield of crops in Brazil.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This directly copied from the website, word for word.

Other than aesthetics and processing, there are no other differences in color.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;White : White paper filters are processed to get that clean, white shade. Chlorine bleaching or natural oxygen bleaching are common methods for whitening paper.

Hario is an exception but they are pricey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though.

Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost.

There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://organon.jimhufford.com/2010/03/things-ive-always-wondered-about-cooling-saucer-edition/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; contains some good links about the topic. I find the most compelling of them to be an article that discusses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_12th/unit3/lesson8/bkgdessay.html&quot;&gt;the use of &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; saucers&lt;/a&gt; for this practice; the saucer is larger and deeper like a shallow bowl, alleviating some of the awkward logistical aspects of drinking from a flat or shallow saucer. Another anecdote, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov/legislative/common/briefing/Senate_legislative_process.htm&quot;&gt;according to US government legend&lt;/a&gt;, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like &lt;a href=&quot;http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/behaviourfood.html&quot;&gt;eating peas off the back of one's fork&lt;/a&gt;.

Cloth filter assemblies should be cleaned right after use with a soft brush and running water, and then soaked in a solution of oxyclean and boiling water. Rinse well after, and store dry. &#xA;  This will not harm the cloth like bleach will, and it comes out sparkling white and odor free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oxyclean is a product that is like washing detergent. Cleans up cloth and fabric quickly and nicely, bringing out good results. Boiling water will help out with the cleaning and disinfecting of the cloth. It will literally burn and kill any harmful bacteria on your cloth. You should clean the cloth immediately after use. This will keep the cloth in top-shape for a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time in its &quot;life&quot; span.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters' cleaning ways are obvious. One use and they are thrown right into the trash. You really can't clean paper filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cleaning glass filters (in my opinion) should be cleaned right after used.

In practice, these glass filters allow a fair amount of sediment to pass into the brewed coffee.

In a pinch, I have tried to make Turkish coffee in a regular handled pan; it simply doesn't work as well. Something magical happens in the neck of a cezve to help that delicious foam to form; the best I can figure is that it's fragile, and the narrower neck somehow helps concentrate the bubbles, helps keep the foam together, and keeps it from collapsing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other examples of equipment size mattering when you're making coffee with other methods:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moka pot.

They were looking&#xA;  for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to be&#xA;  obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through&#xA;  the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals.&#xA;  Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in&#xA;  finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that&#xA;  changed, right? What is the great revolution in science of the last&#xA;  10, 15 years? It is the movement from the search for universals to the&#xA;  understanding of variability. Now in medical science, we don't want to&#xA;  know how necessarily -- just how cancer works, we want to know how&#xA;  your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different&#xA;  from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human&#xA;  variability.

Hot or cold water?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can't really rinse &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the outside/inside of a paper filter. When you drop water on a piece of paper, it doesn't just stick onto the outside/inside, it soaks &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sides of the paper filter. So, both sides. You probably want to soak your filter. This will get rid of any unnecessary chemicals and oils filtered from your filter. This will help make your coffee taste better. Your Serious Eats article is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; accurate. Well, soaking in hot water should do. Hot water will might peal off some paper plus a lot of harmful stuff. It is one-kill wonder for bacteria. The hot water will burn your harmful bacteria to death. So answering your first question: Both, Yes, Hot Water&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's answer your second question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How does it help?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, filters are needed to keep coffee clean by extracting and &quot;keeping&quot; the chemicals and oils. Then, what cleans the filters? This is where rinsing comes in. Let me show you an example. Your clothes keep you clean then you put them in the washing machine to get them clean. So the rinsing is just like the washing machine. Over time, the paper will absorb so many chemicals and oils, the performance goes down like a rock. Some trapped chemicals will join the coffee, allowing the coffee to be contaminated and less tasty. Rinsing will allow the hot water to kill the bacteria and let the filter transfer the chemicals to the water, where it will belong somewhere in a sewer. This will leave the filter very clean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now I will answer your bonus question (Do you award extra rep for this ;-)?): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is being rinsed off?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, the chemicals and oils of course! As said in my previous answer, the water will take the chemicals and oils to the sewer with it. The pores in which the filter needs to cleanse are then empty and more useful. Paper sometimes peel off but will end in the sewer like the chemicals and the water. After one use, it is time for the trash. Of course, first-timers will have to learn that dust and other particles will also ruin the flavor and filter. That is really the &quot;dusty stuff&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Bonus Information About Your Experiments:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looks like they don't work. Sure, most coffee filters will add a papery taste to your coffee, depending on its quality. First, doing the first experiment doesn't really do anything. You need to add coffee, not water, to see a difference. An bad, uncleaned filter will add a papery taste plus some more unwanted taste into your coffee. A good, rinsed filter will add a tiny papery taste to your coffee. Adding something in which it has flavor will make the experiment more fun (a lot more coffee to taste) and effective. That also goes to your second experiment which almost is the first experiment itself for some reason... Anyways, chewing paper filters will &lt;strong&gt;absolutely&lt;/strong&gt; not do anything. All that does is leave you complaining and spitting for the next 12 hours. You might need a mint and some mouthwash after that for personal hygiene reasons :-).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="75" LastActivityDate="2015-02-24T00:36:52.153" CommentCount="2" />

There are several capsule-based espresso machines (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeereview.com/three-new-capsule-espresso-systems/&quot;&gt;here's a review of Nespresso and three others&lt;/a&gt;). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. &quot;pod&quot;, made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;No.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In simple point of fact, &lt;strong&gt;espresso is not &lt;em&gt;traditionally&lt;/em&gt; made with a coffee-filled capsule&lt;/strong&gt;, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html&quot;&gt;INEI&lt;/a&gt; being a benchmark of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf&quot;&gt;espresso production standards (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone&lt;/strong&gt;, with regard to &quot;Certified Italian Espresso&quot; at least. For example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;quantity of coffee (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso&quot;&gt;Nespresso might be light&lt;/a&gt;); &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam); &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure&quot;&gt;using pressure that is too high&lt;/a&gt;, or on the other hand &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262&quot;&gt;too low&lt;/a&gt; for extraction and crema.

Another test disagreed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/&quot;&gt;giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all.

In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[1] pretty good &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm&quot;&gt;pro/con overview from air-n-water&lt;/a&gt; (obscure?);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[2] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldofcaffeine.com/2011/06/20/filter-drip-coffee-paper-vs-metal-filters/&quot;&gt;World of Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[3] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.com/article/281062-health-effects-of-gold-coffee-filters/&quot;&gt;LiveStrong&lt;/a&gt;, which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;[4] from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html&quot;&gt;Melitta&lt;/a&gt;, but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written &lt;em&gt;a lot of text&lt;/em&gt; here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;paper versus metal mesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material.&lt;/strong&gt; There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;metal mesh (stainless steel or &quot;gold tone&quot;);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;nylon (or other plastic) mesh;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare&quot;&gt;this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262&quot;&gt;cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flavour.&lt;/strong&gt; Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost.&lt;/strong&gt; Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for &quot;years&quot; for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean-up.&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time&quot;&gt;how often and how much to clean a permanent filter&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste / environmental issues.&lt;/strong&gt; I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use&quot;&gt;rinse your paper filters&lt;/a&gt;, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; For my money, personally, &lt;strong&gt;I prefer the paper filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Marginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2015-02-27T22:03:44.680" CommentCount="8" />

The most optimal way of &lt;strong&gt;tamping depends on every individual pull&lt;/strong&gt;: the beans (freshness and grind), your skill, machine, etc. at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal (and most important part, in my belief) is to &lt;strong&gt;pack the grounds uniformly.&lt;/strong&gt; Any non-uniformity in your puck will allow water to flow more through certain areas than others, giving you non-uniform extraction across your grounds (some over- and some under-extracted). For example, if your tamper isn't level, you'll end up with a &quot;slanted&quot; puck; if your grounds are packed &lt;em&gt;more loosely&lt;/em&gt; in some places than others... these can yield un-even pucks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, here's a few other common recommendations, some of which you mentioned in the question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add the grounds uniformly and smooth before tamping. This gives you an even bed of grounds so you can tamp evenly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;15 kg / 30 lb. of pressure. A bath scale could help until one gets this &quot;by feel&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use a heavy tamper. This helps you control all of the other parameters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aim for sinking the tamp approximately as far as the bevel (a general rule).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twisting is not necessary (some do at the end of the compression for &quot;polishing&quot;, but not necessary).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there's some controversial bits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Knocking&quot; is something I totally don't understand. The idea is to tap the portafilter so as to somehow redistribute the grounds after tamping. I feel like it would just mess up a good puck, but some recommend it either to ensure uniformity of compression of the bottom and top of the puck, or to get grounds off of the side of the portafilter. More discussion at link [4].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the &quot;North, South, West, East&quot; topic: this illustrates tamping at four points around the portafilter. Since the tamp is &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; smaller than the portafilter, the theory is that tamping at points around the sides helps to prevent grounds from creeping up around the tamp (up the side of the portafilter). It seems to me that an appropriate sized tamp will alleviate most of this, but it seems like a reasonable recommendation. Some guides (e.g., below) recommend this, others don't. More at [1].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few articles on different takes on tamping: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualcoffee.com/jun/perfect.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Virtual Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I Need Coffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/coffeeatthemoment/10-07-2006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2015-03-02T12:04:08.293" LastActivityDate="2015-03-02T12:04:08.293" CommentCount="0" />

So when you add more &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt; coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;) flavor component to your brew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now whether that flavor component contributes to any any &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between &lt;em&gt;&quot;100% fresh&quot;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&quot;Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of &lt;em&gt;soap&lt;/em&gt; on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily &lt;em&gt;tasted&lt;/em&gt; if it is present. But the residuals you are leaving behind in your unwashed-coffee-cup study are still &lt;em&gt;essentially&lt;/em&gt; coffee (somewhat &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; coffee, but coffee nonetheless). So mixing the equivalent of &quot;a few drops&quot; of &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; coffee in a hot cup of fresh I suspect will have no &lt;em&gt;perceptible&lt;/em&gt; effect on taste. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also suspect that your coffee cup experiment is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; evolving over the years. The metallic cup is likely stainless steel or perhaps aluminum (and most coffee cups are made of ceramic). In either case, the cup is largely &lt;em&gt;stainless&lt;/em&gt;, so you are not likely building up any patina&amp;hellip; so you are essentially &quot;washing away&quot; the previous day's experiment each time you add a fresh cup of hot coffee.

The method was to put a couple of fistfuls of loose grounds in one of those giant porcelain coffee pots that look like they came out of a Zane Grey novel.  Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds.  Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils.  Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside.  Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good.  My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise.  The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't believe it would work as well as it did but I'm a believer.

Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&amp;deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tested.com/food/coffee/455840-how-important-coffee-brew-water-temperature/&quot;&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[3] I did mention people can become amazingly pedantic, didn't I?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[4] Known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/ross-droplet-technique-eliminating-grinder-static-t24051.html&quot;&gt;Ross Droplet Technique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="271" LastActivityDate="2015-03-07T00:21:07.180" CommentCount="2" />

You might ask to add also some chocolate powder. Apart from the taste, the powder filling the foam pore gives a pleasant look to the drink. When travelling abroad, I see this as a standard feature, but here it is on request.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The steam is produced from a pump part of quite a large coffee machine, which is the  standard equipment of any  Italian bar. Because of the high pressure involved it is normally not possible to produce a cappuccino at home, at least not using a standard stove. Anyway nowadays they are selling cut down versions of the bar machine, which can produce bar-like cappuccinos (and coffee) even at home. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Temperature is crucial for cappuccino. Hot temperature is necessary to produce the foam, but a too hot cappuccino will hurt your tongue. Contrary to a hot cup of tea, where you can wait for it to become  colder, here when the hot goes away also the foam does, so what you drink is not a cappuccino anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Espresso means express, as you might guess. It is a coffee made with the big machine I mentioned above.&#xA;Contrary to the coffee made at home on the stove, with the so called moka machine, this machine can make a good coffee instantly. That anyway requires this appliance to be already setup (with proper pressure and temperature levels), which takes time but it is done only once, in the morning, when the bar opens. it might help observing that breakfast is almost inexistent in Italy, as it consists for many of a fast and frugal espresso  or cappuccino with a croissant, taken  standing still at the bar before commuting  to you workplace. So speed in brewing pays.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides Italian approach to coffee as a drink is radically different. For what I have seen, in the rest of the world the coffee is drunk in mugs similar to those used for the tea (I am thinking to American coffee for example); here  the size of a coffee cup is extremely small and  this is because the drink is concentrated. To brew the coffee like  this you need water at  high pressure and  high temperature forced  through a  tier of coffee by the coffee machine. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Big espresso machines found in bars are ideal, given their power, to obtain this and generally their output is considered better than moka coffee made at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that contrary to cappuccino, here the higher the temperature the better the taste. To make it drinkable bars use special cups very thick. The final results is that you don't hurt your lips when you drink, also the volume of liquid  going through your mouth is less, and you don't burn your tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have read that the total caffeine in an American coffee is higher, anyway the sensation that you have with an espresso is like you are taking something stronger and we even amplify this effect by drinking it fast, often in one shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the high temperature and pressure, if one does not make the espresso daily, it is very easy to make it  &lt;em&gt;burned&lt;/em&gt;, producing something that is  bitter and distasteful. I have seen many  used  to American coffee (big cups), disliking espresso and vice versa. &#xA;Anyway, before deciding that the strong taste of espresso is not for you, make sure you have tasted a professionally  made one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I said before, there are now home espresso machines, which are also easy to operate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Latte is short for latte macchiato, stained milk. The stain is the a little quantity of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strange as it may seem, in Italy the word espresso is a sort of foreigner word not used at all.

It's large a matter of repetition.

In sum, I believe that this question (as asked) is not answerable (but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; interesting!). With just about &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; selected brewing method, you'll be able to extract almost all of the caffeine from the beans. However, depending on the method chosen, you need to use different parameters to get full extraction (time, pressure, temperature, etc.). For example: Espresso is certainly the fastest to get full caffeine extraction, but you need a fine grind.  Filter/drip or French press are slower, but espresso-fine grind just won't work correctly; you need to use a coarser grind. Given the same beans, and the right technique for the given method, you can achieve almost 100% caffeine extraction.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example of drip versus espresso, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on caffeine&lt;/a&gt; (and the two cited references that include figures on both espresso and drip caffeine content -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_info1.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) claim nearly the same caffeine content for drip versus espresso; in fact, they list that drip coffee has &lt;em&gt;slightly more&lt;/em&gt; caffeine than espresso. I can't fully accept these, however, because there's no way to know if they're using arabica or robusta, light roast or dark roast, how much ground coffee was used to brew -- there's just too many unknowns that back those figures. Since arabica, for instance, is ~1% caffeine, with 7g of coffee (&quot;standard dose&quot;, from INEI) you'll be able to get ~70mg caffeine. Those are pretty consistent with the cited figures -- meaning 100% caffeine extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you'd have to ask a different question in a different way (e.g., what's the fastest extraction method? or How to get 100% caffeine extraction with cold brew?) or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with most of @Chris in AK's answer (and +1!), but I wanted to add another take on this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think solubility is a big factor here; caffeine is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; soluble in hot water -- approaching 66g/100mL (~150g/cup) in boiling water, and even at room temperature nearly 2g/100mL (~5g/cup) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Chemical_properties&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;citation listed at Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB0202769.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Yes, those are listed as &lt;em&gt;grams&lt;/em&gt;, which means that water could dissolve &lt;em&gt;tens to hundreds of times&lt;/em&gt; as much caffeine, as compared to the caffeine dose in an average cup/demitasse of strong coffee or espresso (which contain perhaps ~50mg-200mg per cup; see also questions on caffeine content, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/94/how-much-caffeine-is-in-an-espresso-shot&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;; also keep in mind that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/469/262&quot;&gt;lethal dose of caffeine&lt;/a&gt; is somewhere in the 10g-20g range.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to your actual question, I do agree that you've restricted yourself quite a bit; pressure is one of the few variables you didn't eliminate. To that end: a comparison of extraction of pressure-brewed (e.g., espresso) versus filter/drip follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, caffeine is quickly extracted from coffee beans (and tea leaves); most is extracted within 30 seconds of water contact (though this certainly depends on fineness of grind and other factors). Here's a visualization of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espressoplanet.com/espresso-coffee-machine/pressure_brewed_coffee_extraction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;extraction of comparison of pressure-brewed and drip versus time&lt;/a&gt;, which depicts the quantity of caffeine (and other stuff) extracted over time. I found it amusing that the context of that article is actually advocating for espresso as a way to brew &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; caffeine content coffee; the point being that the &quot;other stuff&quot; (aroma, colour, flavour) is extracted even more quickly with pressure-brewed (versus drip) coffee.  So, if you extract for only 10 seconds (which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; short indeed) you'll get most of the &quot;other stuff&quot; but less caffeine. On the other hand, a finer grind will permit faster extraction of caffeine and everything else; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-espresso-vs-drip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this article suggests that espresso is higher in caffeine based on the grind factor&lt;/a&gt;; I think there are too many other variables for that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2015-03-21T20:52:14.513" LastActivityDate="2015-03-21T20:52:14.513" CommentCount="3" />

It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help &quot;wick&quot; the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrasting the two types of cones:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wB2fc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;between a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the &quot;wells&quot; from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow &quot;seals&quot; itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for &quot;why&quot; this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the &quot;seal&quot; and permits the coffee to drain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar &quot;ridge&quot; that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little &quot;pleats&quot; in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find that this &quot;pooling&quot; happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the &quot;sealing,&quot; but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide&lt;/a&gt; suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2015-03-23T15:35:37.900" CommentCount="0" />

Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds. Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils. Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside. Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good. My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise. The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your method might inlcude a smaller pot and less coffee grounds, but all brew methods are essentially just soaking ground coffee in hot water.

These flavors usually come from unstable molecules that deteriorate quickly after the coffee is brewed. When coffee is brewed and consumed relatively quickly, the drinker can enjoy those flavors. Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want. If you hear about another light roasted coffee that has strong sweetness but is more acidic than you usually like, try it as a cold brew. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.e. if acid is what is holding you back with specific coffees you want to try, try them as a cold brew.&lt;/strong&gt; Just know that the lack of acid in the cold brew may make it a little lack-luster compared to a traditional cup, especially since tasting notes are made when evaluating hot brewed cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Darker roasted coffee as already lost more of the bean flavors and gained more roast flavors. If anything, I would say that a darker roast is going to have a more consistent flavor between hot and cold brewing simply because more of the delicate flavors have already been burned away. I would bet that Kicking Horse and Blue Bottle suggest a medium roast for cold brew because a medium roast preserves the beans own characteristics while introducing the roast flavors. This is why single origins are usually roasted to full city or less. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, I would suggest that you find a coffee you like already as a french press or pour over and cold brew that regardless of roast.&lt;/strong&gt; Lighter roasts may lose some of their complexity in a cold brew, darker roasts will mellow even more in a cold brew.

As it so happens, the origin flavors of roasted coffee fade very quickly (sometimes in as short as a week).  However, the roasting flavors seem to hang around a bit longer.  Large chains dark roast their coffee because it makes it easier to consistently produce close to the same taste and the flavor of those dark roasted bean will hang around a bit longer (less shipping and storage concerns).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastActivityDate="2015-03-27T21:47:34.720" CommentCount="0" />

I read on a roaster's site (I'll try to find the reference) that acidic flavors come out first, sweet compounds second, and bitter flavors last when brewing.  The trick is to stop the extraction before you get the bitter flavors.  Hotter water and finer grounds will extract faster.  Darker roasts will tend to be more harshly flavored than lighter roasts and a fine ground dark bean with very hot water might be undrinkable.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would definitely experiment with your coffee.  200F water is a bit on the hot side, 190-195 is a more common recommendation.  With that temperature, start with 30 seconds, next try 1 minute and so on until you find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; so to speak.  There will definitely be a difference in the taste.  The World Aeropress Championships site is a good start but modifying their methods to suit your taste is easy with an AeroPress.  I see you're already using the inverted method which will very definitely allow you to vary the timing.

Based on the question and comment I believe OP is interested in designing a coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a business standpoint most organizations strive to service segments of the market that organizations believe they have a competitive advantage. These organizations also try to offer products to meet opening (OPP), mid (MPP) and High (HPP) price points. Also branding place a significant part in product pricing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assumption: US dollar = Euro (Approximately, 1 Euro = 1.09 US$) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee Maker Product Landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Based on the above I did some research on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodservicewarehouse.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;food services warehouse&lt;/a&gt; and selected Grindmaster for this analysis.

Each of the price points (PP) most like need a different type of component. The component price to meet the above flow rate specification can be significantly different. Also the product volume is each PP is different thus for HPP or even MPP product it is highly unlikely to obtain volume base pricing that OPP might enjoy. Thus explains the cost of components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImtm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example BOM for  coffee Maker&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Testing, Validation and Manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The cost of testing, validation and manufacturing will be much higher for MPP and HPP product because the consumer demands for higher quality product compared to OPP products.  Thus the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost per machine will much higher for MPP and HPP product than the OPP products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Serviceability and Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;An OPP price point product needs very little from a serviceability and after sale support compared to MPP or HPP product. An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance. Also consider a customer like Starbuck or Panera, they demand for high quality, and zero downtime. Therefore the components used in MPP or HPP coffee makers of significantly higher quality than the OPP coffee makers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Product Pricing VS BOM price -&gt; General rule of thumb is BOM cost is 1/5 the Product Price. I believe this is a good starting point to figure what take to compete in the intended the coffee maker market. It appears that the coffee maker market is a red ocean. Therefore it important identify the point of differentiation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Blue Ocean Strategy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jsedimensions.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Meo-Figure-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Example Coffee Maker BOM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jsedimensions.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Meo-Figure-3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Example Coffee Maker Landscape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jsedimensions.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Meo-Figure-2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Performance Improvement Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ece.cmu.edu/ddl/index.php/Coffeemaker&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Coffee Maker Product Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodservicewarehouse.com/commercial-coffee-makers-grindmaster-single-brew/c3414_1696-215_1704-619.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Grindmaster Single brew coffee maker product offering example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="615" OwnerDisplayName="Mahendra Gunawardena" LastEditorUserId="140" LastEditDate="2015-04-21T10:24:55.317" LastActivityDate="2015-04-21T10:24:55.317" CommentCount="2" />

The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="443" LastActivityDate="2015-04-15T19:08:46.567" CommentCount="2" />

To avoid waste, I only brew as much as I need, so I usually drink it all.  In order to further reduce waste, I have tried metallic net filters instead of paper filters, but they tend to allow an ultra fine silt to pass through, the presence of which at the bottom of the cup is annoying if the plan is to drink all the coffee.  So, I started doing this: first I place a paper filter in the coffee maker, to collect the ultra fine silt, which is actually very small in volume, and inside the paper filter I place the metallic net filter to collect the actual coffee grounds, which are 99% of the volume. Then, I brew my coffee.  When it is time to make more coffee, I only remove and wash the metallic net filter; the paper filter stays in its place, and gets reused about five times before it has collected so much ultra-fine silt that it is time to replace it.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you see anything seriously wrong with this technique?

While you may not necessarily taste the difference from one pot to the next, it has definitely changed your overall expectation of the flavor.  The bouquet of coffee also is very complex, as is obvious from the fact that there is a distinct change in the scent from the time you grind to the time the brewing stops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One flavor issue with reusing paper filters is that they tend to stop a large amount of the oils in the coffee from making it into the final product.

If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso.

Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean&quot;&gt;this Q/A for what I mean by extraction&lt;/a&gt; in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could &lt;strong&gt;try this experimentally&lt;/strong&gt; also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way.

Optimal coffee extraction occurs at temperatures roughly between 185 and 202 degrees F.  You'll need to play with this, because the actual best temperature varies with things like water quality, altitude and, yes, weather.  Those last two are the same reason why recipes often have special steps or settings for high-altitude prep.  I find that, in North Carolina, the best temperature is on the higher end of that range, from 195 to 200 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) Finally, don't stir with a metal spoon during extraction.  Metal is a heat sink and will alter the temperature of the water.  Additionally (this is speculation, as I don't have verification for this), the fact that many coffees are at least mildly acidic can also result in flavor changes with a metal spoon if you stir before adding cream.  The cream is basic and will help neutralize the acid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="676" LastActivityDate="2015-04-21T16:30:27.790" CommentCount="0" />

If anything, it kind of tastes bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, there may be more to the story. Indonesians I know have offered two explanations for why I was unimpressed. And these excuses were not mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One is a lack of certification -- that is, how do you know you were drinking real Kopi Luwak? Hah! Maybe somebody's faking you out!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other excuse is that, even when it's &quot;real&quot;, it might be factory farmed. This excuse is based on the observation (true) that Kopi Luwak used to be produced entirely from excreta by Luwak in the wild, who (according to this story) would eat only the best coffee cherries, often from the best coffee estates. These days, lamentably, most Kopi Luwak is produced by shoveling lots of possibly-mediocre coffee cherries into Luwak pens, then raking up what they crap out. Between (1) the stressed condition of these captive animals, (2) a coffee-cherry-only diet (not very balanced), (3) the lower quality of the coffee they are fed, and perhaps (4) slipshod processing by opportunists who don't really know coffee, Kopi Luwak coffee quality has taken a dive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or so /that/ excuse goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was suprised to find that Kopi Luwak in Indonesia is not really dramatically more expensive. Maybe 30% more than anything comparable, when I was there last year. That margin might be narrowing.

Stretching it is what gives a latte its unique texture (though the micro bubbles add to that).

Hold your hand around the pitcher while it heats, and use the other hand to stir the milk. You can also use one hand and just swirl the milk around in the pitcher - do what feels comfortable, just keep the milk moving. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As soon as the pitcher becomes &lt;em&gt;just less&lt;/em&gt; than too hot for your hand, pull it. Swirl it around a little bit and look inside. Does the milk have a kind of gloss to it similar to Elmer's glue (or any other paste you used in school)? If not, Put it back on the heat for 20 - 30 seconds, swirling it as you do. Once it's got that gloss, and the milk has expanded a bit, it's stretched properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An electric burner is ideal for this, but there are also metal overlays for gas burners that just provide a hot surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At that point you can use a hand whisk, or any number of the frothing gadgets that you can find in any cooking store (brick-and-mortar or online). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can, of course, just froth the milk, but what you're essentially doing is aerating it. That's fine, it's going to make a tasty drink, but it might fall short of your expectations if you don't &lt;em&gt;stretch&lt;/em&gt; the milk as well. The process is what makes the milk and the coffee fall in love and give birth to a latte.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The steam wand on espresso machines heats the milk &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; adds the air, giving you a lot more control over the process. However, this will work almost as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don't ever let the milk get close to simmering. It'll burn very quickly. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use the handle if you have to put the pitcher back on the heat (as naturally, you took it off because it was approaching too hot to hold)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You want to get the milk &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the coffee as soon as possible once it has that gloss. Don't let it cool down too much while frothing (work fast)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's going to take some practice&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Total for this would be about $15 for the stainless steel pitcher, $10 - $15 for the frother, so all total around 30 bucks.

Most good espresso machines allow you to heat cups on the top of them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, my testing is somewhat limited because I drink good quality Arabica beans pretty much exclusively. Arabica has some subtle flavors and it's easy to tell when they're more pronounced. Long blacks &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; hit the caramel notes more, in my experience.

However, I'm not sure how much it really matters to someone kind of fumbling around to get their first cup of the day.

No matter how long or short the grind, there is extreme heterogeneity in particle size--that is, you will find larger bean fragments with near-dust-size ones, with everything in between.  If you use a pour-over or drip brewing method, you might even see whole beans floating to the top. Not surprisingly, you'll get very uneven extraction from these different particles, no matter what the brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you grind long enough to decimate all the beans, you'll find a lot of fine coffee dust and sediment in your cup. Too short a grind, and you get a lot of beans and bean pieces that can't present enough extractable surface area to the hot water, leading to a thin, weak cup. Waste of coffee, to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it's almost impossible to grind any two batches consistently, since grind time is dependent on bean quantity, type of roast, variety of bean--well, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.  So today you'll get a disappointing cup, and tomorrow you'll get another disappointing cup for some other reason. Therefore I recommend a &lt;em&gt;Conical Burr&lt;/em&gt; grinder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conical Burr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beans move through &lt;strong&gt;once&lt;/strong&gt;.  When you set your burr grinder to a certain fineness, there will be very little heterogeneity in particle size.  (N.B.  Spend more on the grinder, get a more even grind.)  This allows you to experiment with the grind as well as the quantity until it's perfect for you, then replicate that recipe perfectly every time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some tips on finding the right burr grinder for your needs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Prices vary from $50 to $1500 for non-commercial grinders.  I'm happy with my $350 Rancilio, which I've had for 10 years without a hint of trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How you like your coffee matters.  A more expensive grinder will do better fine grinds, as for Arabic-style (i.e. Turkish, Greek, Lebanese) coffee.  If you don't drink that, don't spend more for it.  Most burr grinders perform best in the automatic drip range.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The under-$100 burr grinders still manage to throw a lot of fine coffee dust into the grind.  Do your research before buying.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consistency in grind is critical to good espresso.  If this is important to you, be prepared to spend as much on the grinder as you spent on your espresso machine.  It's for a good cause.

They are not disposable and are made to be reused many times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An impermanent filter is generally made out of paper and is disposable and is generally not meant to be reused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Drip Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drip Coffee machines are one of the most common coffee machines for home use. The filter used will either be paper or permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A paper filter for the drip coffee machine will either be flat-bottom or cone-shaped depending on the make and model of the coffee machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat-bottom filters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flat-bottom Filter&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cone shaped filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ntWce.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cone shaped filter&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The permanent filter can take the same shapes, however it is generally a flat-bottom shape yet can be a hybrid between a cone shaped and a flat-bottom shaped filter.

Below is a picture of the aforementioned hybrid filter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/CvRrn.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hybrid cone filter&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Single Cup&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These filters are generally made out of paper and are usually a cone shape which is usually specific/unique to the type of single cup brewing device.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;French (Push) Press&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A french or push uses a permanent filter which is made out of a fine metal mesh.

The entire bottom of the filter has three main parts, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Parts of a French Press Filter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/xrAHF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;French Press Filter Parts&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Espresso Machine&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An espresso machine's filter is called a portafilter. It shaped like a small basket, made out of metal, and has small holes in the metal on the bottom. There are three sizes. The most common are the single and double shot filters and a rarer one is the triple shot filter. They increase in size to hold more ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are generally three types of portafilters in circulation with mainstream home espresso machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Single wall. This is the most common in the industrial setting. It is contains only one wall on the bottom of the filter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Double wall. Think about this as a portafilter for the inexperienced and is most common for the home espresso machine. It has a secondary wall on the bottom of the portafilter with only a few holes in it. The presence of two walls helps to regulate extraction pressure and is therefore good for those who are not very good at tamping pressure and grind size.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pod filter. This is simply a specially designed filter that is the same shape as the others and comes with some home espresso machines. They are used to hold pre-made and pre-packaged espresso pods that one simply drops into the filter and can avoid many of the other steps of traditional espresso brewing such as tamping and grinding.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portafilters (single wall) on left and baskets (which hold them and are upside down) on the right:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZeKtK.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Portafilters&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The filter on the left is a single shot and the filter on the right is a double shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="225" LastActivityDate="2015-05-13T12:33:23.350" CommentCount="0" />

The second is why oil rises, as opposed to sinking or staying in place. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First question. There is an old saying in chemistry that like dissolves like. What this means is that a substance tends to dissolve in another substance if the molecules of the 2 substances have similar electric dipole moments. Think of an electric dipole like you think of a magnet. The magnet has a north and south pole, and south end of one magnet is attracted to the north end of another magnet, and vice versa. The electric dipole has a positively charged end and a negatively charged end. The magnitude of the positive charge can be greater than that of the negative charge, or vice versa. The difference between the magnitudes of the 2 charges and the distance between them determines the moment or strength of the dipole. In general, dipoles with similar strengths dissolve in each other more readily than dipoles with very different strengths. Oil (as in hydrocarbon-based oils) and water have very different dipole moments, so oil and water do not readily dissolve in each other. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the answer has to do with a force called the buoyancy force. This is the force that causes some objects to float in water. Suppose you want to dissolve 1 cubic cm of oil in water. For this to happen, the oil has to displace 1 cubic cm of water. The buoyancy force on the oil is equal to the weight of that 1 cubic cm of water. Oil is less dense than water, so 1 cubic cm of oil weighs less than 1 cubic cm of water. Therefore, the upward buoyancy force on the oil, which is equal to the weight of water displaced, is greater than the downward force of gravity on the oil, also known as the weight of the oil. This inequality of forces causes the oil to rise in the water. If the oil were denser than the water, the oil's weight (the downward force) would exceed the buoyancy force (the upward force), and the oil would sink in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="869" LastActivityDate="2015-05-30T11:16:42.760" CommentCount="0" />

You press the aeropress directly over ice, and it melts the ice to form a perfect ratio of concentrate and water. Whereas most other methods are either diluted, or take time to cool.

As far as my own experience both working as a barista for a few years, and being a over all enthusiast, most grinders don't provide consistent grinds at a coarser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People are right in saying that most home appliance grinders won't produce very consistent grinds. This is partially true. Your typical consumer grade grinder uses a conical burr, and conical burrs work great for finer grinds. I've had 3 different conical grinders, and I've used commercial conical grinders in the past. They all seem to produce fairly inconsistent grinds for coarser settings. However, they work great in espresso machines, which are generally grinding to a very fine grind. When using flat burr grinders I notice a much better consistency in grind at coarser settings. Many will say that the larger the burr and the slower the grind the better consistency you will have. However, I've never experimented with this myself, but I will say that flat burr grinders produce much better coarser grinds than conical burrs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example of a flat burr grinder is one that you would see at a grocery store or a coffee shop. They are generally very expensive, as they're generally fairly large and aimed at commercial use. That said the Baratza Virtuoso is a conical burr grinder, and it's probably good at what just about any conical burr grinder is good at, medium to fine grinds. I will say that one drawback with flat burr grinders is that they're very slow and create massive amounts of heat on fine grinds(espresso/turkish).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd say a conical burr is good for anything near the coarseness of salt and finer, anything beyond that would be best ground in a flat burr grinder. As far as a flat burr grinder, I feel its the size that matters. You'll want a larger disc for more consistency. Its my assumption that with a larger disc a slower speed will grind the coffee slower and more evenly, causing less of the grounds to crack and mash into finer particles while grinding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of this is based off of my own observations, there are a few forums which concur with this, but in general there's not much else to support these claims. Maybe the flat burr grinders I used were simply higher quality than most of the conical burr grinders I've used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My recommendation would be to try a finer grind and see if you get better consistency then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as a blade grinder goes, I'd say absolutely not. I doubt that a blade grinder would ever be more consistent than what you currently have. You can use a blade grinder 100 times and never come out with the same grind size, where as with a cheap burr grinder you'll alway have the same grind even if its not consistent. Even as far as consistency goes, a blade grinder won't achieve this either. I might(maybe..) recommend a blade grinder if you had an auto-dripper, where it wouldn't matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try a finer grind, and let me know if the consistency gets any better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="924" LastActivityDate="2015-06-12T23:00:34.080" CommentCount="0" />

Personally this sounds like it would amount to gut rot, however if you try some lighter roasts or preferably profile roasted beans from areas in Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, they tend to have very wine like qualities. Single origin, profile roasted beans typically have very renounced flavors, and profile roasting typically roasts the bean lighter preserving the tannicy, floral, and somewhat wine like qualities in the bean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might be prefered to eat the cheese with a cold coffee. If you cold brew coffee it tends to bring out the wine like qualities more so than hot brewing. A common method for this is often called &quot;dutch coffee&quot;, where cold/iced water slowly drips over grounds into a vessel over a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as dunking the cheese in the coffee. I'm not so sure about this. I mean there are a lot of cheese out there. As far as anything salty with coffee, I generally think the tastes conflict. Personally I don't dunk anything in my coffee, and when it comes to wine &amp;amp; cheese tasting you don't dunk the cheese in the wine. Perhaps a light cheese that isn't salty would work well dipped in coffee. I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of a soft cheese, but a soft cheese itself wouldn't be easily dunked into coffee. You could try spreading Mascarpone on a biscotti and dipping that. Even a porous cheese is unlikely to absorb and carry the taste of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheese and coffee aren't exactly a pair made in heaven, but I can see it working much like you said, like wine and cheese. However dunking the cheese in the coffee gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Like I said there are some soft cheeses(usually those used in desserts) that I could imagine being dunked in coffee in some manner, but this is more like a dessert with coffee, which makes me think of a traditional italian 4 course meal which usually ends with the &quot;dolce&quot; or dessert which is often accompanied by espresso. Italy typically also uses soft cheeses in their desserts. Tiramisu, which is very well known, is actually a combination of cheese and coffee. However, like I stated the food and the coffee typically remain separate, unless the coffee is an ingredient in the food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think what you're trying to do is interesting, but I'd avoid making your wife a test subject. I'd recommend keeping the coffee and cheese separate. However, they can absolutely be consumed in the same sitting, but I don't imagine the actual tastes meld together well in the same mouthful. If she wants something to dip in her coffee, biscotti is a common choice, and if she wants cheese, try spreading some mascarpone on it. You can have fun with different biscotti variants and fold things like chocolate, fruits, etc into the mascarpone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I come from the renowned cheese state Wisconsin, and I've been a long time coffee enthusiast.

Something that I got in that habit of doing when using moka pots is to boil the water before I put it in the Moka pot, then introducing it to heat, then removing shortly after it starts to percolate. Stumptown illustrates a similar method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot. Though I'm not sure, I have never used an induction stove with a moka pot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something I had not considered is the boiling point increases with pressure. So it might be worth turning the heat up quite a bit beyond 212F/100C. Its pretty difficult to burn water. Then again if you're using an induction stove to avoid heat pollution on the moka pot, then you can just use a traditional stove with the method I described and avoid the need to use an induction stove.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="924" LastEditorUserId="924" LastEditDate="2015-07-20T21:15:23.027" LastActivityDate="2015-07-20T21:15:23.027" CommentCount="0" />

In the &lt;em&gt;frob&lt;/em&gt; pass, we make just &quot;coarse&quot; adjustments to get everything roughly correct. (reinterpreting the hacker usage. This isn't &lt;em&gt;aimless&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Twiddle. In the &lt;em&gt;twiddle&lt;/em&gt; pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more &quot;scientific&quot; manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as &quot;controls&quot; for the quick little &quot;experiments&quot; to check each change.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tweak. In the &lt;em&gt;tweak&lt;/em&gt; pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The controls we have available are the &lt;strong&gt;grind&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dose&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;water quantity&lt;/strong&gt;. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt;. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting &quot;clicks&quot; of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to &quot;full&quot;, maybe a little heaping. This number is your &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the &quot;frob&quot; of the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the &quot;frob&quot; of the water quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the extraction time was long, adjust the grind. This the &quot;frob&quot; of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we've done our &quot;frob&quot; pass. Now &quot;twiddle.&quot; Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to &quot;twiddle&quot; per se: there's no *up and down&quot; here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its &quot;range&quot;, if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There should be no need to &quot;twiddle&quot; the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, one final pass to &quot;tweak&quot;. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white &quot;overextraction stain&quot; where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop &lt;em&gt;just before&lt;/em&gt; the color changes. This tweak gives you &quot;ristretto-quality&quot; shots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Adjusting on-the-fly&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is &quot;comfortable&quot;. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to &quot;ride the wave&quot; of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same three adjustments, &lt;strong&gt;frob&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt;, apply also to dynamic adjustments. &lt;strong&gt;Frob&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;coarsest&lt;/em&gt; control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. &lt;strong&gt;Twiddle&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;medium-grain&lt;/em&gt; control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. &lt;strong&gt;Tweak&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;finest&lt;/em&gt; control is the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a shot pulls 1-second too long, &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a shot pulls 1-second too short, &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt; the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; with more &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), &lt;strong&gt;twiddle&lt;/strong&gt; the grind a little finer so you can achieve the &lt;em&gt;density&lt;/em&gt; with less &lt;em&gt;mass&lt;/em&gt;.

Specifically the Starbucks Mastrena machine, but the ideas should generalize to othe machines of the same class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Rinsing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should always be rinsing. You are not done rinsing until the water runs clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the machine is acting up, give it a cleaning cycle. If a coworker challenges you, ask them why they want to serve bad shots??! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you cannot take the machine down for a cycle (it's too busy at that moment), the following should help, but is no substitute. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Super-automatics that have run hot all morning and then sat relatively idle through midmorning and then run hot again for the after-lunch crowd have what I call the &quot;oatmeal bowl problem&quot;. If you eat some oatmeal and don't rinse the bowl right away, what happens? You know what happens! It gets hard. It becomes a crust. The same thing happens inside the machine. You need to run a cleaning cycle. For reals, dog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Calibrating.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming you don't have access to the real programming mode. So the control here are very, very limited. You can adjust the grind, rinse, and pull shots with one of several programmed buttons. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each programed button maintains a log of the parameters and measurements of the last few shots upon which it performs some simple statistical analysis to determine when to print &quot;adjust grind coarser&quot; or &quot;adjust grind finer&quot; on the screen. So, the machine only &quot;sees&quot; a problem when it becomes a big problem. And it's not designed to respond to (or even detect) &quot;too much inconsistency&quot;. Conquently, always prefer the Log View which shows you the actual numbers to the standard view which only shows you the approximate extraction time averaged over the last several (about 5, I think) shots. On the Mastrena machine, switch to Log View by pressing the Up and Down buttons at the same time; switch back to normal view by pressing Cancel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the numbers are &quot;too inconsistent&quot; (exercise your judgment), then you really need to run a cleaning cycle before trying to calibrate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alright, to actually calibrate a programmed button on a clean machine, take the grind a few clicks &lt;em&gt;coarser&lt;/em&gt; than you think it should be set. Coarser flakes will help to scrub the doser channels between the grinder and the brewing chamber. With a very fine grind, the heat and moisture from the nearby brewing chamber will contribute to &lt;em&gt;caking&lt;/em&gt; in the doser. That gives you a non-linear response from grind-time-adjustment/extraction-time-result. And it is this which I believe is the cause of the usual &quot;death-spiral&quot; of a Super-Automatic before it needs servicing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, you've adjusted to a very coarse grind. Pull 3 or 4 (pairs of) shots, then start adjusting the grind finer 1 click at a time, then pull a shot. 1 click, 1 shot, 1 click, 1 shot. Then just follow house-rules for blackjack. Stand on 16 or 17. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It takes 2 or 3 pairs for a grind adjustment to take effect, depending upon the length of the doser channel in the particular kind of machine. So by the 1-click,1-shot cycle above, we have a 1 or 2 shot backlog of having adjusted finer. This will ride up to about 20sec shots if everything else is normal. So we stop adjusting when the shot times hit the bottom of the desired range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cross-Calibrating single-shot and double-shot programs at the same grind&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have single-shot and double-shot buttons which use the same grinder, then it's possible to have the singles pulling long with the doubles pulling short or any combination of good, bad, and ugly in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The procedure that seem to be working for me is to calibrate the longest program to be correct, and let the machine self-adjust the short program to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Always, always, always, calibrate from the &lt;em&gt;coarse&lt;/em&gt; side of things. This keeps the doser and brewing chamber scrubbed and avoids caking which leads to unpredictable results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="959" LastEditorUserId="959" LastEditDate="2015-08-01T06:22:12.833" LastActivityDate="2015-08-01T06:22:12.833" CommentCount="0" />

In moderation, sugar is a critical part of our diet. If you are combining it with two doughnuts and two further teaspoons of sugar in the coffee (for example) then it could potentially lead to the same insulin cycle that causes weight gain in people who eat too much sugar.  The rapid intake of sugar causes your pancreas to flood your blood stream with insulin, which then drops your blood sugar lower than it should go. That causes cravings for more sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other side is how &quot;carmelized&quot; the sugar is.

When I put dark roast beans into the grinder, the chute gets clogged with coffee grounds more quickly (as compared to lighter-roasted beans).

If you're tamping hard and the grounds are clumping together somehow, you might be getting some channeling (resulting in uneven extraction); this could cause a more &quot;watery&quot; shot. You might be able to see evidence of this in the puck after you pull the shot, or you might be able to see it while pulling the shot if you use a naked (bottomless) portafilter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-guide-diagnose-extraction-problems.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This article from Home-Barista&lt;/a&gt; talks about a too-quick extraction being paired with grind flaws; are you seeing that?

Add about a scoop and a half of ground decent-quality beans to the pot. Swirl gently until chalky bubbles appear. Filter through a tea strainer into a cup. Let stand briefly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No need to grind the beans to a powder. The tea-strainer gets most of the grounds and the amount of sediment in the cup is about the same as in cafe espresso. The only electric component is a coffee grinder. Using pre-ground beans requires more coffee per cup, as some flavor will be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general this method produces coffee that is slightly weaker than espresso. While I might add a bit of sugar to espresso to counter bitterness if the beans are old or mediocre, the strainer method above gives coffee that is very drinkable without sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sometimes surprises me that this simple method isn't more widely used. &lt;strong&gt;Has anyone else tried it?&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any drawbacks to this method?

Almost completely opaque. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/filters.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Chemex filter page&lt;/a&gt; states that they are &quot;20-30% heavier&quot; than other filters and removes finer sediment and &quot;undesirable oils and fats&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Melitta-style is in the middle, and is similar in nature to most other Melitta-style and basket-style filter paper. Thick enough to be mostly opaque, but noticeably thinner than Chemex. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.melitta.com/en/2-Cone-Filter-Paper-Natural-Brown-40-Count-1428,64752.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Melitta brand filters&lt;/a&gt; have claimed &quot;flavor enhancing perforations.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Hario brand is the thinnest by a fair margin. It's almost translucent through most of the filter, with a somewhat leaf-vein-like pattern to it, presumably from paper fibre and production method.

I prefer your &quot;slower&quot; pour method over your friend's... read on for why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Longer story:&#xA;Keeping all other factors identical, here's my take on each. I aggregate information from my own experience and from several other sites (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/bee-house&quot;&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html&quot;&gt;Serious Eats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/guides/howtouseapourover&quot;&gt;Coffee Geek&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature.&lt;/strong&gt; Most agree that water for pour-over should be &lt;strong&gt;just off the boil&lt;/strong&gt;, but exact temperature is both difficult to &lt;em&gt;measure&lt;/em&gt; and to &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt;. Exact recommendations differ, but most (including the 4 above) are approximately in the range of &lt;strong&gt;93-97°C / 200-207°F&lt;/strong&gt;. At this temperature, you extract the best balance of the &quot;right stuff&quot; from the beans. Much hotter or colder than this and it will have an &quot;off&quot; taste, such as more bitter. For example, try brewing coffee at 80°C / 175°F and see how it tastes compared to coffee brewed with 96°C / 205°F water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; technique and equipment, anyway, it would be essentially impossible for me to measure or maintain a temperature this accurately. Removed from the heat, the kettle itself will immediately start to cool; the water will cool between the pour spout and when it hits the grounds in the cone; the water will cool more when sitting on the grounds. For this reason, &lt;em&gt;I take water from a boiling kettle and begin to pour at my leisure.&lt;/em&gt; It might be a few degrees too hot at first, but it will probably finish a few degrees too cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate of pouring the water.&lt;/strong&gt; This seems to have more debate, e.g., on the 4 sites I listed above. Some pour only enough water at a time to have water just covering the grounds (like you and Blue Bottle), and some pour all the way up to the top of the cone (like your friend and Stumptown) -- however, a disadvantage of this all-at-once method is that some of the coffee will get pinned to the side of the cone for the final &quot;drainage&quot; and will not spend as much time in contact with the water; therefore some of your friend's coffee grounds will be underextracted. &lt;strong&gt;I do something of a hybrid: pour at such a rate as to keep the &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; at a steady rate.&lt;/strong&gt; The dripping rate will decrease as the filter gets somewhat clogged with grounds, so I keep very slowly raising the water level in the cone (just exceeding the rate of output); I find this produces the best result. Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also want to consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use&quot;&gt;rinsing your filter&lt;/a&gt;, and see more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/337/what-is-coffee-bloom&quot;&gt;wetting the grounds for coffee bloom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastEditorUserId="262" LastEditDate="2015-07-23T05:06:03.330" LastActivityDate="2015-07-23T05:06:03.330" CommentCount="4" />

In fact, even things that &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; actually coffee (barley, tea, herbs, etc.) could be brewed like coffee in an AeroPress or other coffee-brewing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if fancy coffee is not your preference (or not practical, or not available, or whatever), try something different. And why not a cultural staple like Maxwell House (or Folgers or Nescafé or Eight O'Clock or Café du Monde or ...)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;strong&gt;mass-market coffee like this might &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; from AeroPress treatment.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, some of these blends include a significant portion of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robusta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; beans, which is a traditional component of many blends (including some Italian espresso blends). Robusta might have some advantages in an AeroPress. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/barista/10-14-2006&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Robusta produces &lt;strong&gt;more crema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in espresso, and might be a way to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress&quot;&gt;more crema from AeroPress&lt;/a&gt;. Robusta also has slightly &lt;strong&gt;more caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Arabica&lt;/em&gt;, so that's something else you might be looking for. Since AeroPress (generally) infuses for less time than drip, &lt;strong&gt;you might reduce a bit of the bitterness&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes present in mass-market coffees (regardless of bean makeup).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There might be a few problems, though.&lt;/strong&gt; First, the default grind of pre-ground coffee like &lt;strong&gt;Maxwell House is rather course&lt;/strong&gt; for an AeroPress. You could try to re-grind the coffee to be a bit finer, but it's generally not recommended because it can clog grinders (see more on this from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/can-ground-coffee-be-re-ground-t29153.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Home-Barista&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bunn.com/dr-brew-blog/re-grinding-coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bunn&lt;/a&gt;). Second, if there are other &quot;stuff&quot; in the coffee (e.g., &quot;Folgers Crystals&quot; or other additives) this might not behave the same way in the AeroPress as it might for drip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But give it a try! In the best case, you can enjoy a mass-market coffee even more than you'd expect. In the worst case, you're out a few quid, but you have a fun story and a hefty caffeine buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="262" LastActivityDate="2015-07-24T14:29:45.157" CommentCount="1" />

Other styles of vac-pot (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000IKLQY6&quot;&gt;this Hario model - c/o Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) have a scaffolding that holds the bulb (bottom) and the hopper (top) so the whole apparatus can be suspended over a separate heat source, like an alcohol or butane stove. Check some vac-pot brewing guides that show this type of integrated round-bottom bulb and holder (e.g., from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/siphon&quot;&gt;Blue Bottle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/vacuum-pot&quot;&gt;Stumptown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee&quot;&gt;CoffeeGeek&lt;/a&gt;, and many others).

If the coffee tastes too bitter, then try decreasing the extraction time. Bloom for maybe 8 seconds. It's hard to tell, most people press coffee because they like pressed coffee, and they'll usually use a coarse grind for this.

I would guess you are in the minority of people buy what amounts to black coffee from Starbucks.  Starbucks is a fairly divisive brand among most consumers.  Most of the people I have talked to that like their beverages are buying mixed drinks from them and not straight espresso, drip coffee or americanos.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Starbucks does sell organic, fair trade and the like specialty coffees as whole bean or ground.  However, the vast majority of their beverages sold daily is likely made with whatever their &quot;espresso&quot; blend is.  My personal opinion is that it's horrible and over roasted.   However, it's also consistently the same tasting and consumed on a fairly mass scale daily, so if there were any inherent dangers to it, we'd likely all be aware by now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a brand, Starbucks is mainly aimed at consistency.  In general, that's what fast food chains strive for as well, so in that respect, they are very similar.  Proper branding ensures that you can buy a product at any of hundreds of locations (or thousands) and it will taste the same.  However, many consumers prize quality and uniqueness over consistency.  In most industries (distilling, wine, food, beer) the most expensive and &quot;highest end products&quot; are items that were perhaps only produced at a limited run, or were very good in a particular year.  That mindset tends to be the antithesis of the mass produced &quot;good enough for everyone&quot; standards that huge market brands set for themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;  Yes, Starbucks shares many characteristics with fast food companies.

Unfortunately the symptoms you're seeing, from my perspective, is a classic &lt;em&gt;failure&lt;/em&gt; of the Bialetti design. Aluminum tarnishes (oxidizes) somewhat readily, especially when it is hot and in contact with water. Correspondingly, the only way to use this thing is, indeed, to heat it with water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vessel, especially, needs to be rinsed and &lt;em&gt;dried thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; in The Right Way.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;care&quot; page for Bialetti&lt;/a&gt; (follow that link, then click on the &quot;Care Use&quot; tab; I can't figure a direct link) suggests to &lt;em&gt;dry thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; and most tellingly &quot;Do not reassemble the product until all parts are completely dry to avoid oxidation.&quot; Even if you're meticulously drying the thing, it's still going to be a little hot and a little damp; this is going to invite oxidation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Standard ways of removing tarnish are even more damaging in the long term than just leaving them alone.
